# Example Model and Data

The following is a simple, complete Stan program for a Bernoulli model
of binary data.^[The model is available with the CmdStan distribution at the
path  `<cmdstan-home>/examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.stan`.]
The model assumes the binary observed data `y[1],...,y[N]` are
i.i.d. with Bernoulli chance-of-success `theta`.

```stan
data { 
  int<lower=0> N; 
  array[N] int<lower=0, upper=1> y;
} 
parameters {
  real<lower=0, upper=1> theta;
} 
model {
  theta ~ beta(1, 1);  // uniform prior on interval 0,1
  y ~ bernoulli(theta);
}

```

The input data file contains definitions for the two variables `N` and `y`
which are specified in the data block of program `bernoulli.stan` (above).

A data set of `N=10` observations is included in the example Bernoulli model
directory in both JSON notation and Rdump data format where 8 out of 10 trials
had outcome `0` (failure) and 2 trials had outcome `1` (success).
In JSON, this data is:
```
{
    "N" : 10,
    "y" : [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]
}
```
