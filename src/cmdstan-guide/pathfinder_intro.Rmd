# Variational Inference using Pathfinder {#pathfinder-intro}

The CmdStan method `pathfinder` uses the Pathfinder algorithm of @zhang_pathfinder:2022.
Pathfinder is a variational method for approximately
sampling from differentiable log densities. Starting from a random
initialization, Pathfinder locates normal approximations to the target
density along a quasi-Newton optimization path, with local covariance
estimated using the inverse Hessian estimates produced by the
L-BFGS optimizer.  Pathfinder returns draws from the Gaussian approximation
with the lowest estimated Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to the true
posterior.

Pathfinder differs from the ADVI method in that it uses quasi-Newton
optimization on the log posterior instead of stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
on the Monte Carlo computation of the evidence lower bound (ELBO).
Pathfinder's approach is both faster and more stable than that of ADVI.
Compared to ADVI and short dynamic HMC runs, Pathfinder
requires one to two orders of magnitude fewer log density and gradient
evaluations, with greater reductions for more challenging posteriors.

A single run of the Pathfinder algorithm generates a set of approximate draws.
Inference is improved by running multiple Pathfinder instances and using
Pareto-smoothed importance resampling (PSIS) of the resulting sets of draws.
This better matches non-normal target densities and also eliminates minor modes.
By default, the `pathfinder` method uses 4 independent Pathfinder runs,
each of which produces 1000 approximate draws, which are then
importance resampled down to 1000 final draws.

The following is a minimal call the Pathfinder algorithm using defaults
for everything but the location of the data file.

```
> ./bernoulli pathfinder data file=bernoulli.data.R
```

Executing this command prints both output to the console and csv files.

The first part of the console output reports on the configuration used.
```

```
The rest of the output describes the progression of the algorithm.

By default, the Pathfinder algorithm runs 4 single-path Pathfinders in parallel, the uses importance resampling on the set of returned draws to produce the specified number of draws.

Pathfinder outputs a [StanCSV file](#pathfinder_csv) file which contains the importance resampled draws from multi-path Pathfinder.
The initial CSV comment rows contain the complete set of CmdStan configuration options.
Next is the column header line, followed the set of approximate draws.
The Pathfinder algorithm first outputs `lp_approx__`, the log density in the approximating distribution, and `lp__`,  the log density in the target distribution, followed by estimates of the model parameters, transformed parameters, and generated quantities.
```
lp_approx__,lp__,theta
-2.4973, -8.2951, 0.0811852
-0.87445, -7.06526, 0.160207
-0.812285, -7.07124, 0.35819
...
```

The final lines are comment lines which give timing information.
```
# Elapsed Time: 0.016000 seconds (Pathfinders)
#               0.003000 seconds (PSIS)
#               0.019000 seconds (Total)
```

Pathfinder provides option `save_single_paths` which will save output from the single-path Pathfinder runs.
See section [Pathfinder Method](#pathfinder-config) for details.
