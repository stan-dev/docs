# CmdStan Installation

## Installation via `conda`

CmdStan can be installed via the package management system [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)
via the [conda-forge channel](https://conda-forge.org/). This
will install a pre-built version of CmdStan along with the required
dependencies (i.e. a C++ compiler, a version of Make, and required
libraries) detailed below under [Source installation].

One can create a new conda environment (named `stan-env`)
and install CmdStan with the following command.
```
conda create -n stan-env -c conda-forge cmdstan
```
or install it in an existing environment with
```
conda install -c conda-forge cmdstan
```

The conda installation is designed so one can use the R or Python
bindings to CmdStan seamlessly. Additionally, it provides the command
`cmdstan_model` to activate the CmdStan makefile from anywhere.
To enable either of these, ensure your environment is activated^[A special
environment, called `base`, is activated automatically by conda on startup.
Installing software directly in `base` is not recommended by conda, but may be
appropriate for some users who do not intend to use multiple environments]
with `conda activate <env>`, where `<env>` is the name of
the environment CmdStan was installed into. In the first command
above, the environment was named `stan-env`, but any name may be used
so long as you are consistent.

You can check which version of CmdStan is installed in your current
environment by running the following command.
```
conda list cmdstan
```
Finally, you can specify a different version for installation by adding `=VERSION`
to the end of the above commands.^[You can view available versions with the
command `conda search -c conda-forge cmdstan`] For example,
```
conda install -c conda-forge cmdstan=2.27.0
```

Please report conda-specific install problems directly to the
conda-forge issue tracker,
[here](https://github.com/conda-forge/cmdstan-feedstock/issues).


## Source installation

To install CmdStan from source you need:

- A modern C++11 compiler.  [Supported versions](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Coding-Style-and-Idioms#supported-cpp-versions-and-compilers) are
    + Linux: g++ 4.9.3 or clang 6.0
    + macOS: the XCode version of clang
    + Windows: g++ 8.1 (available with RTools 4.0) is recommended; alternatively, g++ 4.9.3 (available with RTools 3.5).

- The [GNU-Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)
utility program or the Windows equivalent `mingw32-make`.
On macOS, this is part of the XCode command line tools installed via command `xcode-select --install`.
On Windows, `mingw32-make` is installed as part of RTools: https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/.

- The CmdStan C++ source code and libraries.

    + [CmdStan releases](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan/releases)  are available from GitHub as a compressed tarfile containing all C++ source code and libraries.  The most recent CmdStan release is always available as https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan/releases/latest.

    + To use the current development version you can [clone the GitHub repo](#git-clone.section).

The CmdStan release unpacks into a directory called `cmdstan-<version>` where the
version string consists of the major.minor.patch version numbers, e.g. `cmdstan-2.23.0`.
Cloning CmdStan from GitHub creates a directory simply called `cmdstan`.
Throughout this manual, we refer to this top-level CmdStan source directory as **`<cmdstan-home>`**.


### Installing the C++ toolchain

The C++ toolchain consists of a modern C++ compiler and the GNU-Make utility,
described in greater detail in the following section.

#### Linux:  `g++` and `make`


On Linux, the C++ compiler command `g++` and the GNU-Make command is `make`.
These are often installed by default.
To check, run commands:

```
g++ --version
make --version
```

If these are at least at `g++` version 4.9.3 or later and
`make` version 3.81 or later, no additional installations are
necessary. It may still be desirable to update the C++ compiler
`g++`, because later versions are faster.

To install the latest version of these tools (or upgrade an older
version), use the following commands or their equivalent for your
distribution, install via the commands:

```
sudo apt install g++
sudo apt install make
```

If you can't run `sudo`, you will need to ask your sysadmin
or cluster administrator to install these tools for you.

#### MacOS:  `clang++` and `make`

To install a C++ development
environment on a Mac, use Apple's Xcode development environment
https://developer.apple.com/xcode/.

From the [Xcode home page](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
`View in Mac App Store`.

- From the App Store, click `Install`, enter an Apple ID, and wait
for Xcode to finish installing.
-  Open the Xcode application, click top-level menu `Preferences`,
click top-row button `Downloads`, click button for
`Components`, click on the `Install` button to the right of
the `Command Line Tools` entry, then wait for it to finish
installing.
- Click the top-level menu item `Xcode`, then click item `Quit
Xcode` to quit.

To test, open the Terminal application and enter:
```
clang++ --version
make --version
```

If you have installed XCode, but don't have `make`, you can install the
XCode command-line tools via command:
```
xcode-select --install
```

_Note_ MacOS installations may include old version of the `g++` compiler which is a version 4.2.1.
CmdStan requires g++ at 4.9.3 or later.  Trying to install later versions of g++ using `homebrew`
or `macports` is no longer recommended; use the XCode toolchain.


#### Windows:  `g++` and `mingw32-make`  {#windows-make}

The Windows toolchain consists of programs `g++`, the C++ compiler,
and `mingw32-make`, the GNU-Make utility.
To check if these are present,
open a command shell [^1]
and type:
```
g++ --version
mingw32-make --version
```

__Rtools C++ Development Environment__

The simplest way to install a full C++ build environment that will
work for CmdStan is to use the Rtools package designed for R
developers on Windows (even if you don't plan to use R).

If you don't have RTools, the latest version is `Rtools40` (released April 2020)
which can be downloaded from:

- https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/

After installation is complete, you need to perform one more step:
you need to add the location of the Rtools compiler and make utilities
to the `PATH` environment variable.  If you have `Rtools40`, these should be:
```
C:\RTools\RTools40\usr\bin
C:\RTools\RTools40\mingw64\bin
```

If you have and earlier version of RTools, use `RTools35`:
```
C:\RTools\RTools35\usr\bin
C:\RTools\RTools35\mingw64\bin
```

See [these instructions](https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/)
for details on changing the `PATH`.

__32-bit Builds__

CmdStan defaults to a 64-bit build. On a 32-bit operating system, you must specify
the make variable `BIT=32` as part of the `make` command, described in the next section.

### GNU-Make utility {#gnu-make}

CmdStan relies on the GNU-make utility to build both the
Stan model executables and the CmdStan tools.

GNU-Make builds executable programs and libraries from source code by reading files
called Makefiles which specify how to derive the target program.
A Makefile consists of a set of recursive rules where each rule
specifies a target, its dependencies,
and the specific operations required to build the target.
Specifying dependencies for a target provides a way to control
the build process so that targets which depend on other files will
be updated as needed _only_ when there are changes to those other files.
Thus Make provides an efficient way to manage complex software.

The CmdStan Makefile is in the `<cmdstan-home>` directory
and is named `makefile`. This is one of the default
[GNU Makefile names](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Makefile-Names.html),
which allows you to omit the `-f makefile` argument to the Make command.
Because the CmdStan Makefile includes several other Makefiles,
**Make only works properly when invoked from the `<cmdstan-home>` directory**;
attempts to use this Makefile from another directory by specifying the
full path to the file `makefile` won't work.
For example, trying to call Make from another directory by specifying
the full path the the makefile results in the following set of error messages:

```
make -f ~/github/stan-dev/cmdstan/makefile
/Users/mitzi/github/stan-dev/cmdstan/makefile:58: make/stanc: No such file or directory
/Users/mitzi/github/stan-dev/cmdstan/makefile:59: make/program: No such file or directory
/Users/mitzi/github/stan-dev/cmdstan/makefile:60: make/tests: No such file or directory
/Users/mitzi/github/stan-dev/cmdstan/makefile:61: make/command: No such file or directory
make: *** No rule to make target `make/command'.  Stop.
```

Makefile syntax allows general pattern rules based on file suffixes.
Stan programs must be stored in files with suffix `.stan`; the
CmdStan makefile rules specify how to transform the Stan source code
into a binary executable.
For example, to compile the Stan program `my_program.stan` in directory `../my_dir/`,
the make target is `../my_dir/my_program` or ` ../my_dir/my_program.exe` (on Windows).

To call Make, you invoke the utility name, either `make` or `mingw32-make`, followed by, in order:

- zero or more [Make program options](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Options-Summary.html), then specify any Make variables as a series of

- zero of more Make variables, described below

- zero or more _target_ names; the set of names is determined by the Makefile rules.

```
make <flags> <variables> <targets>
```


__Makefile Variables__

Make targets can be preceded by any number of Makefile variable name=value pairs.
For example, to compile `../my_dir/my_program.stan` for an OpenCL (GPU) machine,
set the makefile variable `STAN_OPENCL` to `TRUE`:
```
> make STAN_OPENCL=TRUE ../my_dir/my_program    # on Windows use mingw32-make
```
Makefile variables can also be set by creating a file named `local` in the
CmdStan `make` subdirectory which contains a list of `<VARIABLE>=<VALUE>` pairs,
one per line.   For example, if you are working on a 32-bit machine,
you would put the line `BIT=32` into the file `<cmdstan-home>/make/local`
so that all CmdStan programs and Stan models compile properly.

The complete set of Makefile variables can be found in file
`<cmdstan-home>/cmdstan/stan/lib/stan_math/make/compiler_flags`.

__Make Targets__

When invoked without any arguments at all, Make prints a help message:
```
> make    # on Windows use mingw32-make
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CmdStan v2.23.0 help

  Build CmdStan utilities:
    > make build

    This target will:
    1. Install the Stan compiler bin/stanc from stanc3 binaries.
    2. Build the print utility bin/print (deprecated; will be removed in v3.0)
    3. Build the stansummary utility bin/stansummary
    4. Build the diagnose utility bin/diagnose
    5. Build all libraries and object files compile and link an executable Stan program

    Note: to build using multiple cores, use the -j option to make, e.g.,
    for 4 cores:
    > make build -j4


  Build a Stan program:

    Given a Stan program at foo/bar.stan, build an executable by typing:
    > make foo/bar

    This target will:
    1. Install the Stan compiler (bin/stanc), as needed.
    2. Use the Stan compiler to generate C++ code, foo/bar.hpp.
    3. Compile the C++ code using cc . to generate foo/bar

  Additional make options:
    STANCFLAGS: defaults to "". These are extra options passed to bin/stanc
      when generating C++ code. If you want to allow undefined functions in the
      Stan program, either add this to make/local or the command line:
          STANCFLAGS = --allow_undefined
    USER_HEADER: when STANCFLAGS has --allow_undefined, this is the name of the
      header file that is included. This defaults to "user_header.hpp" in the
      directory of the Stan program.


  Example - bernoulli model: examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.stan

    1. Build the model:
       > make examples/bernoulli/bernoulli
    2. Run the model:
       > examples/bernoulli/bernoulli sample data file=examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.data.R
    3. Look at the samples:
       > bin/stansummary output.csv


  Clean CmdStan:

    Remove the built CmdStan tools:
    > make clean-all

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### Clone the GitHub CmdStan repository {#git-clone.section}

This section can be skipped if you want to build CmdStan using the release tarfile,
which contains all source files an libraries needed to build CmdStan.
However, if you wish to use the current (stable) development version of CmdStan,
you must clone the [CmdStan GitHub repo](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan).

The CmdStan repo contains just the `cmdstan` module;
the Stan inference engine algorithms and Stan math library functions
are specified as [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
and stored in the GitHub repositories
[stan](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan) and [math](https://github.com/stan-dev/math),
respectively.
By cloning the CmdStan repository with argument `--recursive`,
Git automatically initializes and updates each submodule in the repository,
including nested submodules if any of the submodules
in the repository have submodules themselves.

The following sequence of commands will check out the current
CmdStan `develop` branch on GitHub and assemble and build the
command line interface and supporting libraries:

```
> git clone https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan.git --recursive
> cd cmdstan
> make build    # on Windows use mingw32-make
```

The resulting set of directories should have the same structure as the release:

- directory `cmdstan/stan` contains the sub-module `stan` (https://github.com/stan-dev/stan)
- directory `cmdstan/stan/lib/stan_math` contains the sub-module `math` (https://github.com/stan-dev/math)

### Building CmdStan

Building CmdStan involves preparing a set of executable programs
and compiling the command line interface and supporting libraries.
The CmdStan tools are:

- `stanc`: the Stan compiler (translates Stan language to C++).

- `stansummary`: a basic posterior analysis tool.
The `stansummary` utility processes one or more output files from a run
or set of runs of Stan's HMC sampler.
For all parameters and quantities of interest in the Stan program,
`stansummary` reports a set of statistics including mean, standard deviation,
percentiles, effective number of samples, and $\hat{R}$ values.

- `diagnose`: a basic sampler diagnostic tool which checks for indications
that the HMC sampler was unable to sample from the full posterior.

CmdStan releases include pre-built binaries of the Stan language
compiler \url {https://github.com/stan-dev/stanc3}:
`bin/linux-stanc`, `bin/mac-stanc` and
`bin/windows-stanc`. The CmdStan makefile `build` task
copies the appropriate binary to `bin/stanc`. For CmdStan
installations which have been cloned of downloaded from the CmdStan
GitHub repository, the makefile task will download the appropriate
OS-specific binary from the stanc3 repository's nightly release.

Steps to build CmdStan:

- Download the latest release from https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan/releases/latest
or [clone the GitHub repo](#git-clone.section).

- Open a command-line terminal window and change directories to the CmdStan home directory.

- Run the makefile target `build` which instantiates the CmdStan utilities
and compiles all necessary C++ libraries.

```
> cd <cmdstan-home>
> make build    # on Windows use mingw32-make
```

If your computer has multiple cores and sufficient ram, the build process
can be parallelized by providing the `-j` option. For example, to build on 4 cores, type:
```
> make -j4 build    # on Windows use mingw32-make
```

When `make build` is successful, the directory `<cmdstan-home>/bin/`
will contain the executables `stanc`, `stansummary`, and `diagnose` (on Windows, corresponding `.exe` files)
and the final lines of console output will show the version of CmdStan
that has just been built, e.g.:
```
--- CmdStan v2.23.0 built ---
```

**Warning:**  _The Make program may take 10+ minutes and consume 2+ GB of memory to build CmdStan._

**Windows only:** CmdStan requires that the Intel TBB library,
which is built by the above command, can be found by the Windows system.
This requires that the directory
`<cmdstan-home>/stan/lib/stan_math/lib/tbb` is part of the
`PATH` environment variable.
To permanently make this setting for the current user, you may execute:
```
> mingw32-make install-tbb
```
After changing the `PATH` environment variable, you must open an new shell
in order to these setting to take effect.
(This is not necessary on Mac and Linux systems because they can use the
absolute path to the Intel TBB library when linking into Stan programs.)


## Checking the Stan compiler

To check that the CmdStan installation is complete
and in working order, run the following series of commands
from the folder which CmdStan was installed.

On Linux/macOS:

```
# compile the example
> make examples/bernoulli/bernoulli

# fit to provided data (results of 10 trials, 2 out of 10 successes)
> ./examples/bernoulli/bernoulli sample data file=examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.data.json

# default output written to file `output.csv`,
# default num_samples is 1000, output file should have approx. 1050 lines
> ls -l output.csv

# run the `bin/stansummary utility to summarize parameter estimates
> bin/stansummary output.csv
```

On Windows:

```
# compile the example
> mingw32-make examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.exe

# fit to provided data (results of 10 trials, 2 out of 10 successes)
> ./examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.exe sample data file=examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.data.json

# run the `bin/stansummary.exe utility to summarize parameter estimates
> bin/stansummary.exe output.csv
```

The sample data in file `bernoulli.json.data` specifies 2 out of 10 successes, therefore
the range `mean(theta)`$\pm$`sd(theta)` should include 0.2.

## Troubleshooting the installation

Updates to CmdStan, changes in compiler options, or updates to the
C++ toolchain may result in errors when trying to compile a Stan program.
Often, these problems can be resolved by removing the existing CmdStan binaries
and recompiling.  To do this, you must run the makefile commands
from the `<cmdstan-home>` directory:

```
> cd <cmdstan-home>
> make clean-all    # on Windows use mingw32-make
> make build
```

### Common problems

This section contains solutions to problems reported on https://discourse.mc-stan.org

**Compiler error message about PCH file**

To speed up compilation, the Stan makefile pre-compiles parts of the core Stan library.
If these pre-compiled files are out of sync with the compiled model, the compiler will complain, e.g.:

```
error: PCH file uses an older PCH format that is no longer supported
```

In this case, clean and rebuild CmdStan, as shown in the previous section.


**Windows: 'mingw32-make' is not recognised**

If the C++ toolchain has been installed but not properly registered,
then the call to `mingw32-make` will result in error message:
```
'mingw32-make' is not recognised as an internal or external command
```
To fix this, you should make sure that the RTools installation is
in your `PATH` environment variable, as described in the [RTools section](#windows-make).

In addition, if you have the RTools 4.0 toolchain, then call the utility `pacman`
to register the right version of make:
```
pacman -Sy mingw-w64-x86_64-make
```
See: https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/cmdstan-installation-on-windows/11287/6


**Windows: 'g++' or 'cut' is not recognized**

The CmdStan makefile uses a few shell utilities which might not be present in Windows,
resulting in the error message:
```
'cut' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
```
The solution is to add `mingw_64/bin` directory to the user `PATH` environment variable.  See:
https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/errors-when-using-cmdstan-model/14984/21
