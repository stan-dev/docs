This is the official reference manual for Stan's *programming
language* for coding probability models, *inference algorithms* for
fitting models and making predictions, and *posterior analysis* tools
for evaluating the results.  This manual applies to all Stan
interfaces.

There are two additional interface-neutral manuals, the
[*Stan Functions Reference*](https://mc-stan.org/docs/functions-reference/index.html)
listing all the built-in functions and their signatures,
and the [*Stan User's Guide*](https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/index.html)
providing examples and programming techniques.
There is also a separate installation and getting started guide for
each interface.
