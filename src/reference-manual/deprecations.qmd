# Deprecated Features

This appendix lists currently deprecated functionality along with how
to replace it.

Starting with Stan 2.29, minor (syntax-level) deprecations can be removed 3
versions after release; e.g., syntax deprecated in Stan 2.20 will be removed in
Stan 2.23 and placed in [Removed Features](removals.qmd). The Stan compiler can
[automatically update](https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/using-stanc.html#stanc-pretty-printing)
many of these on the behalf of the user for at least one version after they are
removed.

Any feature which changes semantic meaning (such as the upgraded ODE solver
interface) will not be removed until a major version change (e.g., Stan 3.0).


## `lkj_cov` distribution

*Deprecated*:The distribution `lkj_cov` is deprecated.

*Replacement*: Replace `lkj_cov_lpdf(...)` with an `lkj_corr`
  distribution on the correlation matrix and independent lognormal
  distributions on the scales.  That is, replace

```stan
cov_matrix[K] Sigma;
// ...
Sigma ~ lkj_cov(mu, tau, eta);
```

with

```stan
corr_matrix[K] Omega;
vector<lower=0>[K] sigma;
// ...
Omega ~ lkj_corr(eta);
sigma ~ lognormal(mu, tau);
// ...
cov_matrix[K] Sigma;
Sigma <- quad_form_diag(Omega, sigma);
```

The variable `Sigma` may be defined as a local variable in the model
block or as a transformed parameter.  An even more efficient transform
would use Cholesky factors rather than full correlation matrix types.


*Scheduled Removal*: Stan 3.0 or later.

## New Keywords

*Deprecated*: The following identifiers will become reserved in the language in the specified version.

*Replacement*: Rename any variables or functions with these names.

| Identifier | Version |
|------------|---------|
| jacobian   | 2.38    |

## Deprecated Functions

Several built-in Stan functions have been deprecated. Consult the
[functions reference](https://mc-stan.org/docs/functions-reference/deprecated-functions.html)
for more information.
