# Using the Stan Compiler

Stan is used in most of our
[interfaces](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/) through the Stan compiler
`stanc`. Since version 2.22, the Stan compiler has been implemented in OCaml and
is referred to as [stanc3](https://github.com/stan-dev/stanc3). The binary name
is still simply `stanc`, so this document uses both stanc and stanc3
interchangably.

## Command-line options for stanc3 {#stanc-args}

The stanc3 compiler has the following command-line syntax:

```
> stanc (options) <model_file>
```
where `<model_file>` is a path to a Stan model
file ending in suffix `.stan`.

The stanc3 options are:

- `--help` - Displays the complete list of stanc3 options, then exits.

- `--version` - Display stanc version number

- `--info` - Print information about the model, such
as the type information for variables and the list of used distributions.

- `--name=<model_name>` - Specify the name of the class
used for the implementation of the Stan model in the generated C++ code.

- `--o=<file_name>` -  Specify the name of the file into
which the generated C++ is written.

- `--allow-undefined` - Do not throw a parser error if there is a function in
  the Stan program that is declared but not defined in the functions block.

- `--include_paths=<dir1,...dirN>` - Takes a comma-separated list
  of directories that may contain a file in an `#include` directive.

- `--use-opencl` - If set, will use additional Stan OpenCL
  features enabled in the Stan-to-C++ compiler.

- `--auto-format` - Pretty prints the program to the console. See [more on auto
  formatting](#stanc-pretty-printing).

- `--print-canonical` - Similar to `--auto-format`, but program is also updated
  to remove deprecated features and canonicalize the program when possible.

- `--print-cpp` - If set, output the generated C++ Stan model class to stdout.

- `--O` - Allow the compiler to apply all optimizations to the Stan
  code. **WARNING:** _This is currently an experimental feature!_

- `--warn-uninitialized` - Emit warnings about uninitialized variables
  to stderr. Currently an experimental feature.

- `--warn-pedantic` - Emit warnings in [Pedantic mode](#pedantic-mode)
  which warns of potential issues in the meaning of your program.

The compiler also provides a number of debug options which are
primarily of interest to stanc3 developers; use the `--help`
option to see the full set.

## Understanding stanc3 errors and warnings

During model compilation, stanc can produce a variety of errors (issues that
prevent the model from being compiled) and warnings (non-fatal issues that
should still be considered).

### Warnings

Even without the optional `--warn-pedantic` and `--warn-uninitialized` [command
line flags](#stanc-args), both of which enable additional warnings, stanc can still
produce warnings about your program. In particular, warnings will be produced
in two situations

1. A completely blank Stan program will produce the following warning message
   ```
   Warning: Empty file 'empty.stan' detected;
   this is a valid stan model but likely unintended!
   ```
2. The use of any [deprecated
   features](https://mc-stan.org/docs/reference-manual/deprecated-features-appendix.html)
   will lead to warnings which will look as follows
   ```
   Warning in 'deprecated.stan', line 2, column 2:
   Comments beginning with # are deprecated.
   Please use // in place of # for line comments.
   ```

A single Stan program can produce many warnings during compilation.


### Errors

Errors differ from warnings in their severity and format. In particular, errors
are _fatal_ and stop compilation, so at most one error is displayed per run of
stanc.

There are four kinds of errors emitted by stanc3

1. File errors occur when the file passed to stanc is either missing or cannot
   be opened (i.e. has permissions issues). They look like
   ```
   Error: file 'notfound.stan' not found or cannot be opened
   ```
2. Syntatic errors occur whenever a program violates the Stan language's
   [syntax](https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_27/reference-manual/language-syntax.html)
   requirements. There are three kinds of errors within syntax errors; "lexing"
   errors mean that the input was unable to be read properly on the character
   level, "include" errors which occur when the `#include` directive fails, and
   "parsing" errors which result when the structure of the program is incorrect.

   * The lexing errors occur due to the use of invalid characters in a program.
     For example, a lexing error due to the use of `$` in a variable name will
     look like the following.

     ```
     Syntax error in 'char.stan', line 2, column 6, lexing error:
     -------------------------------------------------
       1:  data {
       2:     int $ome_variable;
                  ^
       3:  }
     -------------------------------------------------
     Invalid character found.
     ```

   * When an include directive is used, it can lead to errors if the included file
     is not found, or if a file includes itself (including a recursive loop of
     includes, such as A -> B -> A).

     ```
     Syntax error in './incl.stan', line 1, column 0, included from
     './incl.stan', line 1, column 0, included from
     'incl.stan', line 1, column 0, include error:
     -------------------------------------------------
       1:  #include <incl.stan>
           ^
     -------------------------------------------------
     File incl.stan recursively included itself.
     ```

   * It is much more common to see parsing errors, which tend to have more
     in-depth explanations of the error found. For example, if a user forgets to
     put a size on a type like vector, as in the following, this raises a parsing
     (structural) error in the compiler.
     ```
     Syntax error in vec.stan', line 3, column 10 to column 11, parsing error:
     -------------------------------------------------
       1:  data {
       2:     int<lower=0> N;
       3:     vector x;
                     ^
       4:  }
     -------------------------------------------------
     "[" expression "]" expected for vector size.
     ```

3. Semantic errors (also known as type errors) occur when a program is stuctured
   correctly but features an error in the [type
   rules](https://mc-stan.org/docs/reference-manual/extra-grammatical-constraints.html)
   imposed by the language. An example of this is assigning a real value to a
   variable defined as an integer.
   ```
   Semantic error in 'type.stan', line 2, column 3 to column 15:
   -------------------------------------------------
     1:  transformed data {
     2:     int x = 1.5;
            ^
     3:  }
   -------------------------------------------------
   Ill-typed arguments supplied to assignment operator =: lhs has
   type int and rhs has type real
   ```
4. Finally, the compiler can raise an internal error. These are caused by bugs
   in the compiler, **not** your model, and we would appreciate it if you report
   them on the [stanc3 repo](https://github.com/stan-dev/stanc3/issues) with the
   error message provided. These errors usually say something like "This should
   never happen," and we apologize if they do.



## Pedantic mode

Pedantic mode is a compilation option built into Stanc3 that warns you about
potential issues in your Stan program.

For example, consider the following program.

```stan
data {
  int N;
  array[N] real x;
}
parameters {
  real sigma;
}
model {
  real mu;
  x ~ normal(mu, sigma);
}
```

When pedantic mode is turned on, the compiler will produce the following warnings.

```
Warning:
  The parameter sigma has no priors.
Warning at 'ped-mode-ex1.stan', line 10, column 14 to column 16:
  The variable mu may not have been assigned a value before its use.
Warning at 'ped-mode-ex1.stan', line 10, column 18 to column 23:
  A normal distribution is given parameter sigma as a scale parameter
  (argument 2), but sigma was not constrained to be strictly positive.
```

Here are the kinds of issues that pedantic mode will find (which are described
in more detail in following sections):

-   *Distribution usages issues.* Distribution arguments don't match the
    distribution specification, or some specific distribution is used in an
    inadvisable way.
-   *Unused parameter.* A parameter is defined but doesn't contribute to target.
-   *Large or small constant in a distribution.* Very large or very small
    constants are used as distribution arguments.
-   *Control flow depends on a parameter.* Branching control flow (like if/else)
    depends on a parameter value .
-   *Parameter has multiple twiddles.* A parameter is on the left-hand side of
    multiple twiddles.
-   *Parameter has zero or multiple priors.* A parameter has zero or more than
    one prior distribution.
-   *Variable is used before assignment.* A variable is used before being
    assigned a value.
-   *Strict or nonsensical parameter bounds.* A parameter is given questionable
    bounds.

Some important limitations of pedantic mode are listed at the end of this chapter.


### Distribution argument and variate constraint issues

When an argument to a built-in distribution certainly does not match that
distribution's specification in the [Stan Functions
Reference](https://mc-stan.org/docs/functions-reference/index.html), a warning
is thrown. This primarily checks if any distribution argument's bounds at
declaration, compile-time value, or subtype at declaration (e.g. `simplex`) is
incompatible with the domain of the distribution. x

For example, consider the following program.

```stan
parameters {
  real unb_p;
  real<lower=0> pos_p;
}
model {
  1 ~ poisson(unb_p);
  1 ~ poisson(pos_p);
}
```

The parameter of `poisson` should be strictly positive, but `unb_p` is not constrained to be positive.

Pedantic mode produces the following warning.

```
Warning at 'ex-dist-args.stan', line 6, column 14 to column 19:
  A poisson distribution is given parameter unb_p as a rate parameter
  (argument 1), but unb_p was not constrained to be strictly positive.
```


### Special-case distribution issues

Pedantic mode checks for some specific uses of distributions that may indicate a
statistical mistake:


#### Uniform distributions

Any use of uniform distribution generates a warning, except when the variate
parameter's declared `upper` and `lower` bounds exactly match the uniform
distribution bounds. In general, assigning a parameter a uniform distribution
can create non-differentiable boundary conditions and is not recommended.

For example, consider the following program.

```stan
parameters {
  real a;
  real<lower=0, upper=1> b;
}
model {
  a ~ uniform(0, 1);
  b ~ uniform(0, 1);
}
```

`a` is assigned a uniform distribution that doesn't match its constraints.

Pedantic mode produces the following warning.

```
Warning at 'uniform-warn.stan', line 6, column 2 to column 20:
  Parameter a is given a uniform distribution. The uniform distribution is
  not recommended, for two reasons: (a) Except when there are logical or
  physical constraints, it is very unusual for you to be sure that a
  parameter will fall inside a specified range, and (b) The infinite gradient
  induced by a uniform density can cause difficulties for Stan's sampling
  algorithm. As a consequence, we recommend soft constraints rather than hard
  constraints; for example, instead of giving an elasticity parameter a
  uniform(0, 1) distribution, try normal(0.5, 0.5).
```


#### (Inverse-) Gamma distributions

Gamma distributions are sometimes used as an attempt to assign an improper prior
to a parameter. Pedantic mode gives a warning when the Gamma arguments indicate
that this may be the case.


#### lkj\_corr distribution

Any use of the `lkj_corr` distribution generates a warning that suggests using
the Cholesky variant instead. See
<https://mc-stan.org/docs/functions-reference/lkj-correlation.html> for details.


### Unused parameters

A warning is generated when a parameter is declared but does not have any effect
on the program. This is determined by checking whether the value of the `target`
variable depends in any way on each of the parameters.

For example, consider the following program.

```stan
parameters {
  real a;
  real b;
}
model {
  a ~ normal(1, 1);
}
```

`a` participates in the density function but `b` does not.

Pedantic mode produces the following warning.

```
Warning:
  The parameter b was declared but was not used in the density calculation.
```


### Large or small constants in a distribution

When numbers with magnitude less than 0.1 or greater than 10 are used as
arguments to a distribution, it indicates that some parameter is not scaled to
unit value, so a warning is thrown. See
<https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/standardizing-predictors-and-outputs.html>
for a discussion of scaling parameters.

For example, consider the following program.

```stan
parameters {
  real x;
  real y;
}
model {
  x ~ normal(-100, 100);
  y ~ normal(0, 1);
}
```

The constants `-100` and `100` suggest that `x` is not unit scaled.

Pedantic mode produces the following warning.

```
Warning at 'constants-warn.stan', line 6, column 14 to column 17:
  Argument -100 suggests there may be parameters that are not unit scale;
  consider rescaling with a multiplier (see manual section 22.12).
Warning at 'constants-warn.stan', line 6, column 19 to column 22:
  Argument 100 suggests there may be parameters that are not unit scale;
  consider rescaling with a multiplier (see manual section 22.12).
```


### Control flow depends on a parameter

Control flow statements, such as `if`, `for` and `while` should not depend on
parameters or functions of parameters to determine their branching conditions.
This is likely to introduce a discontinuity into the density function. Pedantic
mode generates a warning when any branching condition may depend on a parameter
value.

For example, consider the following program.

```stan
parameters {
  real a;
}
model {
  // x depends on parameter a
  real x = a * a;

  int m;

  // the if-then-else depends on x which depends on a
  if(x > 0) {
    //now m depends on x which depends on a
    m = 1;
  } else {
    m = 2;
  }

  // for loop depends on m -> x -> a
  for (i in 0:m) {
    a ~ normal(i, 1);
  }
}
```

The `if` and `for` statements are control flow that depend (indirectly) on the value of the parameter `m`.

Pedantic mode produces the following warning.

```
Warning at 'param-dep-cf-warn.stan', line 11, column 2 to line 16, column 3:
  A control flow statement depends on parameter(s): a.
Warning at 'param-dep-cf-warn.stan', line 19, column 2 to line 21, column 3:
  A control flow statement depends on parameter(s): a.
```


### Parameters with multiple twiddles

A warning is generated when a parameter is found on the left-hand side of more than one ~ statements (or an equivalent `target +=` conditional density statement). This pattern is not inherently an issue, but it is unusual and may indicate a mistake.

Pedantic mode only searches for repeated statements, it will not for example generate a warning when a ~ statement is executed repeatedly inside of a loop.

For example, consider the following program.

```stan
data {
  real x;
}
parameters {
  real a;
  real b;
}
model {
  a ~ normal(0, 1);
  a ~ normal(x, 1);

  b ~ normal(1, 1);
}
```

Pedantic mode produces the following warning.

```
Warning at 'multi-twiddle.stan', line 9, column 2 to column 19:
  The parameter a is on the left-hand side of more than one twiddle
  statement.
```


### Parameters with zero or multiple priors

A warning is generated when a parameter appears to have greater than or less than one prior distribution factor.

This analysis depends on a [*factor graph*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_graph) representation of a Stan program. A factor F that depends on a parameter P is called a *prior factor for P* if there is no path in the factor graph from F to any data variable except through P.

One limitation of this approach is that the compiler cannot distinguish between *modeled* `data` variables and other convenient uses of `data` variables such as data sizes or hyperparameters. This warning assumes that all data variables (except for `int` variables) are modeled data, which may cause extra warnings.

For example, consider the following program.

```stan
data {
  real x;
}
parameters {
  real a;
  real b;
  real c;
  real d;
}
model
{
  a ~ normal(0, 1); // this is a prior
  x ~ normal(a, 1); // this is not a prior, since data is involved

  b ~ normal(x, 1); // this is also not a prior, since data is involved

  // this is not a prior for c, since data is involved through b
  // but it is a prior for b, since the data is only involved through b
  c ~ normal(b, 1);

  //these are multiple priors:
  d ~ normal(0, 1);
  1 ~ normal(d, 1);
}
```

One prior is found for `a` and for `b`, while `c` only has a factor that touches a `data` variable and `d` has multiple priors.

Pedantic mode produces the following warning.

```
Warning:
  The parameter c has no priors.
Warning:
  The parameter d has 2 priors.
```


### Variables used before assignment

A warning is generated when any variable is used before it has been assigned a value.

For example, consider the following program.

```stan
transformed data {
  real x;
  if (1 > 2) {
    x = 1;
  } else {
    print("oops");
  }
  print(x);
}
```

Since `x` is only assigned in one of the branches of the `if` statement, it might get to `print(x)` without having been assigned to.

Pedantic mode produces the following warning.

```
Warning at 'uninit-warn.stan', line 7, column 8 to column 9:
  The variable x may not have been assigned a value before its use.
```


### Strict or nonsensical parameter bounds

Except when there are logical or physical constraints, it is very unusual for you to be sure that a parameter will fall inside a specified range. A warning is generated for all parameters declared with the bounds `<lower=.., upper=..>` except for `<lower=0, upper=1>` or `<lower=-1, upper=1>`.

In addition, a warning is generated when a parameter bound is found to have `lower >= upper`.

For example, consider the following program.

```stan
parameters {
  real<lower=0, upper=1> a;
  real<lower=-1, upper=1> b;
  real<lower=-2, upper=1012> c;
}
model {
  c ~ normal(b, a);
}
```

Pedantic mode produces the following warning.

```
Warning:
  Your Stan program has a parameter c with a lower and upper bound in its
  declaration. These hard constraints are not recommended, for two reasons:
  (a) Except when there are logical or physical constraints, it is very
  unusual for you to be sure that a parameter will fall inside a specified
  range, and (b) The infinite gradient induced by a hard constraint can cause
  difficulties for Stan's sampling algorithm. As a consequence, we recommend
  soft constraints rather than hard constraints; for example, instead of
  constraining an elasticity parameter to fall between 0, and 1, leave it
  unconstrained and give it a normal(0.5, 0.5) prior distribution.
```


### Pedantic mode limitations


* Constant values are sometimes uncomputable

  Pedantic mode attempts to evaluate expressions down to literal values so that
  they can be used to generate warnings. For example, in the code `normal(x, 1 -
  2)`, the expression `1 - 2` will be evaluated to `-1`, which is not a valid
  variance argument so a warning is generated. However, this strategy is
  limited; it is often impossible to fully evaluate expressions in finite time.

* Container types

  Currently, indexed variables are not handled intelligently, so they are
  treated as monolithic variables. Each analysis treats indexed variables
  conservatively (erring toward generating fewer warnings).

* Data variables

  The declaration information for `data` variables is currently not considered,
  so using `data` as incompatible arguments to distributions may not generate
  the appropriate warnings.

* Control flow dependent on parameters in nested functions

  If a parameter is passed as an argument to a user-defined function within
  another user-defined function, and then some control flow depends on that
  argument, the appropriate warning will not be thrown.


## Automatic updating and formatting of Stan programs {#stanc-pretty-printing}

In addition to compiling Stan programs, stanc3 features several [flags](#stanc-args)
which can be used to format Stan programs and update them to the most recent
Stan syntax by removing any
[deprecation
features](https://mc-stan.org/docs/reference-manual/deprecated-features-appendix.html)
which can be automatically replaced.

### Automatic formatting

Invoking `stanc --auto-format <model_file>` will print a version of your model
which has been re-formatted. The goal is to have this automatic formatting stay
as close as possible to the [Stan Program Style Guide]. This means spacing,
identation, and line length are all regularized. _Some_ deprecated features,
like the use of `#` for line comments, are replaced, but the goal is mainly to
preserve the program while formatting it.

### Canonicalizing

Invoking `stanc --print-canonical <model_file>` will also print a formatted
version of your program, but it will first make several changes to the code to
reflect changes in syntax and deprecations to the language. This can be a great
tool for updating older Stan models and silencing deprecation warnings.

Some of the changes made are:

* Removing unnecessary extra parenthesis

  `y = ((x-1))` $\to$ `y = x - 1`

* Replacing deprecated assignment operators

  `y <- 0` $\to$ `y = 0`

* Updating the suffix of (included or user-defined) distributions

  `my_distribution_cdf_log` $\to$ `my_distribution_lcdf`

* Replacing inline conditionals with the ternary if operator

  `if_else(a,b,c)` $\to$ `a ? b : c`

* Replacing some deprecated functions with their drop-in replacements

  `abs(2.4)` $\to$ `fabs(2.4)`

* Replacing `increment_log_prob` calls with `target+=` statements

* Replacing single-statement branches with blocks.

  For example, the following statement

  ```stan
  if (cond)
    #result
  ```

  will be formatted as follows
  
  ```stan
  if (cond) {
    #result
  }
  ```
  
  and similarly for For/While loops containing a single statement.
  
### Known issues

The formatting and canonicalizing features of stanc3 are still under
development. The following are some known issues one should be aware of before
using either:

* Oddly placed comments

  If your Stan program features comments in unexpected places, such as inside an
  expression, they may be moved in the process of formatting. Moved comments are
  prefixed with the string `^^^:` to indicate they originally appeared higher in
  the program.

  For example, the following program

  ```stan
  generated quantities {
    real x = 2;
    real y = x /* comment */ - 1;
  }
  ```

  will be formatted as follows

  ```stan
  generated quantities {
    real x = 2;
    real y = x - 1;

    /* ^^^: comment */
  }
  ```

  One can avoid this by not placing comments directly inside an expression, and
  we hope to improve this functionality in future versions.
