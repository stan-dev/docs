This is the official reference manual for [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/)'s *programming
language* for coding probability models, *inference algorithms* for
fitting models and making predictions, and *posterior analysis* tools
for evaluating the results.  This manual applies to all Stan
interfaces.

The first part of the reference manual provides a full specification
of the Stan programming language.  The language is
responsible for defining a log density function conditioned on data.
Typically, this is a Bayesian posterior, but it may also be a
penalized likelihood function.  The second part of the manual
specifies the inference algorithms and posterior inference tools.
The third part provides auxiliary information about the use of Stan.
