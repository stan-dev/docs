# Generating Quantities of Interest from a Fitted Model  {#gc-intro}

The [generated quantities block](https://mc-stan.org/docs/reference-manual/program-block-generated-quantities.html)
computes *quantities of interest* (QOIs) based on the data,
transformed data, parameters, and transformed parameters.
It can be used to:

-  generate simulated data for model testing by forward sampling
-  generate predictions for new data
-  calculate posterior event probabilities, including multiple
   comparisons, sign tests, etc.
-  calculating posterior expectations
-  transform parameters for reporting
-  apply full Bayesian decision theory
-  calculate log likelihoods, deviances, etc. for model comparison

The `generate_quantities` method allows you to generate additional quantities
of interest from a fitted model without re-running the sampler.
Instead, you write a modified version of the original Stan program
and add a generated quantities block or modify the existing one
which specifies how to compute the new quantities of interest.
Running the `generate_quantities` method on the new program
together with sampler outputs (i.e., a set of draws)
from the fitted model runs the generated quantities block
of the new program using the the existing sample by plugging
in the per-draw parameter estimates for the computations in
the generated quantities block.
See the Stan User's Guide section
[Stand-alone generated quantities and ongoing prediction](
https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/stand-alone-generated-quantities-and-ongoing-prediction.html)
for further details.

To illustrate how this works we use the `generate_quantities` method
to do posterior predictive checks using the estimate of `theta` given
the example bernoulli model and data, following the
[posterior predictive simulation](
https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/posterior-predictive-simulation-in-stan.html)
procedure in the Stan User's Guide.

We write a program `bernoulli_ppc.stan` which contains
the following generated quantities block, with comments
to explain the procedure:
```stan
generated quantities {
  real<lower=0, upper=1> theta_rep;
  array[N] int y_sim;
  // use current estimate of theta to generate new sample
  for (n in 1:N) {
    y_sim[n] = bernoulli_rng(theta);
  }
  // estimate theta_rep from new sample
  theta_rep = sum(y_sim) * 1.0 / N;
}
```
The rest of the program is the same as in `bernoulli.stan`.

The `generate_method` requires the sub-argument `fitted_params`
which takes as its value the name of a Stan CSV file.
The per-draw parameter estimates from the `fitted_params` file will
be used to run the generated quantities block.

If we run the `bernoulli.stan` program for a single chain to
generate a sample in file `bernoulli_fit.csv`:

```
> ./bernoulli sample data file=bernoulli.data.json output file=bernoulli_fit.csv
```

Then we can run the `bernoulli_ppc.stan` to carry out the posterior predictive
checks:

```
> ./bernoulli_ppc generate_quantities fitted_params=bernoulli_fit.csv \
                  data file=bernoulli.data.json \
                  output file=bernoulli_ppc.csv
```

The output file `bernoulli_ppc.csv` consists of just the values for the variables declared in the generated quantities block, i.e., `theta_rep` and the elements of `y_sim`:

```
# model = bernoulli_ppc_model
# method = generate_quantities
#   generate_quantities
#     fitted_params = bernoulli_fit.csv
# id = 0 (Default)
# data
#   file = bernoulli.data.json
# init = 2 (Default)
# random
#   seed = 2135140492 (Default)
# output
#   file = bernoulli_ppc.csv
#   diagnostic_file =  (Default)
#   refresh = 100 (Default)
theta_rep,y_sim.1,y_sim.2,y_sim.3,y_sim.4,y_sim.5,y_sim.6,y_sim.7,y_sim.8,y_sim.9,y_sim.10
0.2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
0.3,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
0.8,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
0.1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
0.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
```

_Note_: the only relevant analysis of the resulting CSV output is computing per-column statistics; this can easily be done in Python, R, Excel or similar,
or you can use the CmdStanPy and CmdStanR interfaces which provide a
better user experience for this workflow.

Given the current implementation, to see the fitted parameter values for each draw,
create a copy variable in the generated quantities block, e.g.:

```stan
generated quantities {
  real<lower=0, upper=1> theta_cp = theta;
  real<lower=0, upper=1> theta_rep;
  array[N] int y_sim;
  // use current estimate of theta to generate new sample
  for (n in 1:N) {
    y_sim[n] = bernoulli_rng(theta);
  }
  // estimate theta_rep from new sample
  theta_rep = sum(y_sim) * 1.0 / N;
}
```

Now the output is slightly more interpretable: `theta_cp` is the same as the `theta`
used to generate the values `y_sim[1]` through `y_sim[1]`.
Comparing columns `theta_cp` and `theta_rep` allows us to see how the
uncertainty in our estimate of `theta` is carried forward
into our predictions:

```
theta_cp,theta_rep,y_sim.1,y_sim.2,y_sim.3,y_sim.4,y_sim.5,y_sim.6,y_sim.7,y_sim.8,y_sim.9,y_sim.10
0.102391,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
0.519567,0.2,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
0.544634,0.6,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
0.167651,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
0.167651,0.1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
```
