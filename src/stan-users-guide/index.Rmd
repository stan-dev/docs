#### About this user's guide {-}

This is the official user's guide for Stan.  It provides example
models and programming techniques for coding statistical models in Stan.

- Part 1 gives Stan code and discussions for several important classes
of models.

- Part 2 discusses various general Stan programming techniques that are
not tied to any particular model.

- Part 3 introduces algorithms for calibration and model checking that
requie multiple runs of Stan.

- The appendices provide an introduction to the stanc3 compiler used in the
  various interfaces to Stan, a style guide, and advice for users of BUGS and
  JAGS.

In addition to this user's guide, there are two reference manuals for
the Stan language and algorithms.  The [*Stan Reference Manual*](https://mc-stan.org/docs/reference-manual/index.html)
specifies the Stan programming language and inference algorithms. The
[*Stan Functions Reference*](https://mc-stan.org/docs/functions-reference/index.html)
specifies the functions built into the Stan programming language.

There is also a separate installation and getting started guide for
each of the Stan [interfaces](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/) (R, Python,
Julia, Stata, MATLAB, Mathematica, and command line).

We recommend working through this guide using the textbooks _Bayesian
Data Analysis_ and _Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with
Examples in R and Stan_ as references on the concepts, and using the
[*Stan Reference Manual*](https://mc-stan.org/docs/reference-manual/index.html)
when necessary to clarify programming issues.

#### Web resources {-}

Stan is an open-source software project, resources for which are
hosted on various web sites:

* The [Stan Web Site](https://mc-stan.org/) organizes all of the resources
for the Stan project for users and developers.  It contains links to
the official Stan releases, source code, installation instructions,
and full documentation, including the latest version of this manual,
the user's guide and the getting started guide for each interface,
tutorials, case studies, and reference materials for developers.

* The [Stan Forums](https://discourse.mc-stan.org) provide structured
message boards for questions, discussion, and announcements related to
Stan for both users and developers.

* The [Stan GitHub Organization](https://github.com/stan-dev) hosts all
of Stan's code, documentation, wikis, and web site, as well as the
issue trackers for bug reports and feature requests and interactive
code review for pull requests.

#### Acknowledgements {-}

The Stan project could not exist without developers, users, and
funding.  Stan is a highly collaborative project.  The individual
contributions of the Stan developers to code is tracked through GitHub
and to the design conversation in the Wikis and forums.

Users have made extensive contributions to documentation in the way
of case studies, tutorials and even books.  They have also reported
numerous bugs in both the code and documentation.

Stan has been funded through grants for Stan and its developers,
through in-kind donations in the form of companies contributing
developer time to Stan and individuals contributing their own time to
Stan, and through donations to the open-source scientific software
non-profit NumFOCUS.  For details of direct funding for the project,
see the web site and project pages of the Stan developers.
