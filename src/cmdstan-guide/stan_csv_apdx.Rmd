# Stan CSV File Format {#stan_csv}

The output from all CmdStan methods is in [CSV format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values).
A Stan CSV file is a data table where the columns are the method and model parameters and quantities of interest.
Each row contains one record's worth of data in plain-text format using the comma character (',')
as the field delimiter (hence the name).

For the Stan CSV files, data is strictly numerical,
however, possible values include both positive and negative
infinity and "Not-a-Number" which are represented as
the strings `NaN`, `inf`, `+inf`, `-inf`.
All other values are written in decimal notation with
at most 6 digits of precision.

Stan CSV files have a header row containing the column names.
They also make extensive use of CSV comments,
i.e., lines which begin with the `#` character.
In addition to initial and final comment rows,
some methods also put comment rows in the middle of the data table,
which makes it difficult to use many of the commonly used CSV parser packages.

## CSV column names and order

The data table is laid out with zero or more method-specific columns followed by
the Stan program variables declared in the parameter block,
then the variables in the transformed parameters block, finally variables
declared in the generated quantities, in declaration order.

Stan provides three types of container objects: arrays, vectors, and matrices.
In order to output all elements of a container object, it is necessary to choose
an indexing notation and a serialization order.
The Stan CSV file indexing notation is

- The column name consists of the variable name followed by the element indices.
- Indices are delimited by periods ('.').
- Indexing is 1-based, i.e., given a dimension of size $N$, the first
element index is $1$ and the last element index is $N$.

Container variables are serialized in 
[column major order](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2015/memory-layout-of-multi-dimensional-arrays),
a.k.a. "Fortran" order.
In column major-order, all elements of column 1 are listed in ascending order,
followed by all elements of column 2, thus the 
first index changes the slowest and the last index changes the fastest.

To see how this works, consider a 3-dimensional variable with dimension sizes 2, 3, and 4,
e.g., an array of matrices, a 2-D array of vectors or row_vectors, or a 3-D array of scalars.
Given a Stan program with model parameter variable:
```
 array[2, 3, 4] real foo;
```
The Stan CSV file will require 24 columns to output the elements of `foo`.
The first 6 columns will be labeled:
```
foo.1.1.1, foo.1.1.2, foo.1.1.3, foo.1.1.4, foo.1.2.1, foo.1.2.2
```
The final 6 columns will be labeled:
```
foo.2.2.3, foo.2.2.4, foo.2.3.1, foo.2.3.2, foo.2.3.3, foo.2.3.4
```

## MCMC sampler CSV output

The sample method produces both a Stan CSV output file and a [diagnostic file](#sampler-diag-file)
which contains the sampler parameters together with the gradients on the unconstrained scale and
log probabilities for all parameters in the model.


To see how this works, we show snippets of the output file resulting from the following command:

```
./bernoulli sample save_warmup=1 num_warmup=200 num_samples=100 \
            data file=bernoulli.data.json \
            output file=bernoulli_samples.csv
```

### Sampler Stan CSV output file

The sampler output file contains the following:

- Initial comment rows listing full CmdStan argument configuration.
- Header row
- Data rows containing warmup draws, if run with option `save_warmup=1`
- Comment rows for adaptation listing step size and metric used for sampling
- Sampling draws
- Comment rows giving timing information

**Initial comments rows: argument configuration**

All configuration arguments are listed, one per line, indented according to
CmdStan's hierarchy of arguments and sub-arguments.
Arguments not overtly specified on the command line are annotated as `(Default)`.

In the above example the `num_samples`, `num_warmup`, and `save_warmup` arguments
were specified, whereas subargument `thin` is left at its default value,
as seen in the initial comment rows:

```
# stan_version_major = 2
# stan_version_minor = 24
# stan_version_patch = 0
# model = bernoulli_model
# method = sample (Default)
#   sample
#     num_samples = 100
#     num_warmup = 200
#     save_warmup = 1
#     thin = 1 (Default)
#     adapt
#       engaged = 1 (Default)
#       gamma = 0.050000000000000003 (Default)
#       delta = 0.80000000000000004 (Default)
#       kappa = 0.75 (Default)
#       t0 = 10 (Default)
#       init_buffer = 75 (Default)
#       term_buffer = 50 (Default)
#       window = 25 (Default)
#     algorithm = hmc (Default)
#       hmc
#         engine = nuts (Default)
#           nuts
#             max_depth = 10 (Default)
#         metric = diag_e (Default)
#         metric_file =  (Default)
#         stepsize = 1 (Default)
#         stepsize_jitter = 0 (Default)
# id = 0 (Default)
# data
#   file = bernoulli.data.json
# init = 2 (Default)
# random
#   seed = 2991989946 (Default)
# output
#   file = bernoulli_samples.csv
#   diagnostic_file = bernoulli_diagnostics.csv
#   refresh = 100 (Default)
```

Note that when running multi-threaded programs which use `reduce_sum`
for [high-level parallelization](#parallelization), the number of threads used
will also be included in this initial comment header.


**Column headers**

The CSV header row lists all sampler parameters, model parameters, transformed parameters, and quantities of interest.
The sampler parameters are described in detail in the [output file](#mcmc_output_csv) section of the Quickstart Guide chapter on MCMC Sampling.
The example model `bernoulli.stan` only contains one parameter `theta`, therefore the CSV file data table
consists of 7 sampler parameter columns and one column for the model parameter:
```
lp__,accept_stat__,stepsize__,treedepth__,n_leapfrog__,divergent__,energy__,theta
```

As a second example, we show the output of the `eight_schools.stan` model on run on example dataset.
This model has 3 parameters:  `mu`, `theta` a vector whose length is dependent on the input data,
here `N = 8`, and `tau`.
The initial columns are for the 7 sampler parameters, as before.
The column headers for the model parameters are:
```
mu,theta.1,theta.2,theta.3,theta.4,theta.5,theta.6,theta.7,theta.8,tau
```

**Data rows containing warmup draws**

When run with option `save_warmup=1`,
the thinned warmup draws are written to the CSV output file
directly after the CSV header line.
Since the default option is `save_warmup=0`, this section is
usually not present in the output file.

Here we specified `num_warmup=200` and left `thin` at the default value $1$,
therefore the next 200 lines are data rows containing
the sampler and model parameter values for each warmup draw.
```
-6.74827,1,1,1,1,0,6.75348,0.247195
-6.74827,4.1311e-103,14.3855,1,1,0,6.95087,0.247195
-6.74827,1.74545e-21,2.43117,1,1,0,7.67546,0.247195
-6.77655,0.99873,0.239791,2,7,0,6.81982,0.280619
-6.7552,0.999392,0.323158,1,3,0,6.79175,0.26517
```

**Comment rows for adaptation**

During warmup, the sampler adjusts the stepsize and the metric.
At the end warmup, the sampler outputs this information as comments.

```
# Adaptation terminated
# Step size = 0.813694
# Diagonal elements of inverse mass matrix:
# 0.592879
```

As the example bernoulli model only contains a single parameter,
and as the default metric is `diag_e`, the inverse mass matrix is a $1 \times 1$ matrix,
and the length of the diagonal vector is also $1$.

In contrast, if we run the eight schools example model with metric `dense_e`, the adaptation
comments section lists both the stepsize and the full $10 \times 10$ inverse mass matrix:
```
# Adaptation terminated
# Step size = 0.211252
# Elements of inverse mass matrix:
# 25.6389, 17.3379, 13.9455, 15.9036, 15.1953, 8.73729, 16.9486, 14.4231, 17.4969, 0.518757
# 17.3379, 79.8719, 12.2989, -1.28006, 9.92895, -3.51622, 10.073, 22.0196, 19.8151, 4.71028
# 13.9455, 12.2989, 36.1572, 12.8734, 11.9446, 9.09582, 9.74519, 10.9539, 12.1204, 0.211353
# 15.9036, -1.28006, 12.8734, 59.9998, 10.245, 8.03461, 16.9754, 3.13443, 9.68292, -1.36097
# 15.1953, 9.92895, 11.9446, 10.245, 43.548, 15.3403, 13.0537, 7.69818, 10.1093, 0.155245
# 8.73729, -3.51622, 9.09582, 8.03461, 15.3403, 39.981, 12.7695, 1.16248, 6.13749, -2.08507
# 16.9486, 10.073, 9.74519, 16.9754, 13.0537, 12.7695, 45.8884, 11.6074, 8.96413, -1.15946
# 14.4231, 22.0196, 10.9539, 3.13443, 7.69818, 1.16248, 11.6074, 49.4083, 18.9169, 3.15661

```

_Note that when  the sampler is run with arguments `algorithm=fixed_param`,
this section will be missing._


**Data rows containing sampling draws**

The output file contains the values for the thinned set draws during sampling.
Here we specified `num_sampling=100` and left `thin` at the default value $1$,
therefore the next 100 lines are data rows containing
the sampler and model parameter values for each sampling iteration.
```
-8.76921,0.796814,0.813694,1,1,0,9.75854,0.535093
-6.79143,0.979604,0.813694,1,3,0,9.13092,0.214431
-6.79451,0.955359,0.813694,2,3,0,7.19149,0.289341
```

**Timing information**

Upon successful completion, the sampler writes timing
information to the output CSV file as a series of final comment lines:
```
# 
#  Elapsed Time: 0.005 seconds (Warm-up)
#                0.002 seconds (Sampling)
#                0.007 seconds (Total)
#
```


### Diagnostic CSV output file

The diagnostic file contains the following:

- Initial comment rows listing full CmdStan argument configuration.
- Header row
- Data rows containing warmup draws, if run with option `save_warmup=1`
- Sampling draws
- Comment rows giving timing information

The columns in this file contain, in order:
 - all sampler parameters
 - all model parameter estimates
 - the latent Hamiltonian for each parameter
 - the gradient for each parameters

The labels for the latent Hamiltonian columns are the parameter column label with prefix `p_` and the labels for the gradient columns are the parameter column label with prefix `g_`.

These are the column labels from the file `bernoulli_diagnostic.csv`:
```
lp__,accept_stat__,stepsize__,treedepth__,n_leapfrog__,divergent__,energy__,theta,p_theta,g_theta
```

### Profiling CSV output file

The profiling information is stored in a plain CSV format with no meta
information in the comments.

Each row represents timing information collected in a `profile` statement
for a given thread. It is possible that some `profile` statements have only
one entry (if they were only executed by one thread) and others have
multiple entries (if they were executed by multiple threads).

The columns are as follows:

- `name`, The name of the `profile` statement that is being timed
- `thread_id`, The thread that executed the `profile` statement
- `total_time`, The combined time spent executing statements inside the
`profile` which includes calculation with and without automatic
differentiation
- `forward_time`, The time spent in the `profile` statement during the
forward pass of a reverse mode automatic differentiation calculation or during
a cauculation without automatic differentiation
- `reverse_time`, The time spent in the `profile` statement during the reverse
(backward) pass of reverse mode automatic differentiation
- `chain_stack`, The number of objects allocated on the chaining automatic
differentiation stack. There is a function call for each of these objects in
the reverse pass
- `no_chain_stack`, The number of objects allocated on the non-chaining
automatic differentiation stack
- `autodiff_calls`, The total number of times the `profile` statement was
executed with automatic differentiation
- `no_autodiff_calls` - The total number of times the `profile` statement was
executed without automatic differentiation
