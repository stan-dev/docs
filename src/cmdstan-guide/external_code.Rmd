# Using external C++ code {#using-external-cpp-code}

The `--allow_undefined` flag can be passed to the call to stanc,
which will allow undefined functions in the Stan language to be parsed
without an error. We can then include a definition of the function in
a C++ header file.
This requires specifying two makefile variables:
- `STANCFLAGS=--allow_undedefined`
- `USER_HEADER=<header_file.hpp>`, where `<header_file.hpp>` is the name of a header file that
defines a function with the same name and signature in a namespace
that is formed by concatenating the `class_name` argument to
stanc documented above to the string `_namespace`


As an example, consider the following variant of the Bernoulli example

```stan
functions {
  real make_odds(real theta);
}
data {
  int<lower=0> N;
  array[N] int<lower=0, upper=1> y;
}
parameters {
  real<lower=0, upper=1> theta;
}
model {
  theta ~ beta(1, 1); // uniform prior on interval 0, 1
  y ~ bernoulli(theta);
}
generated quantities {
  real odds;
  odds = make_odds(theta);
}
```
Here the `make_odds` function is declared but not defined, which
would ordinarily result in a parser error. However, if you put
`STANCFLAGS = --allow_undefined` into the `make/local` file
or into the `stanc` call, then the stanc compiler will translate
this program to C++, but the generated C++ code will not compile
unless you write a file
such as `examples/bernoulli/make_odds.hpp` with the following lines
```
#include <boost/math/tools/promotion.hpp>
#include <ostream>

namespace bernoulli_model_namespace {
          template <typename T0__>  inline  typename
          boost::math::tools::promote_args<T0__>::type  make_odds(const T0__&
theta, std::ostream* pstream__) {
       return theta / (1 - theta);  }
       }
```
Given the above, the following `make` invocation should work
```
> make STANCFLAGS=--allow_undefined USER_HEADER=examples/bernoulli/make_odds.hpp examples/bernoulli/bernoulli # on Windows add .exe
```
Alternatively, you could put `STANCFLAGS` and `USER_HEADER` into the
`make/local` file instead of specifying them on the command-line.

If the function were more complicated and involved functions in the
Stan Math Library, then you would need to prefix the function calls
with `stan::math::`  The `pstream__` argument is mandatory
in the signature but need not be used if your function does not print
any output. To see the necessary boilerplate look at the corresponding
lines in the generated C++ file.
