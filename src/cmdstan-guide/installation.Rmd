# CmdStan Installation

There are a few ways that you can install CmdStan.
Depending on your operating system and your level of expertise,
you can either:

+ Use the [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) package management system
to install a pre-built version of CmdStan along with the required dependencies.
*Recommended for Windows users*.

+ Install the source code from [GitHub CmdStan repository](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan).
This requires a modern C++ compiler and toolchain.
See the [C++ Toolchain](#cpp-toolchain) section for further details.

## Installation via `conda` {#conda-install}

With conda, you can install CmdStan from the
[conda-forge channel](https://conda-forge.org/).
This will install a pre-built version of CmdStan along with the required
dependencies (i.e. a C++ compiler, a version of Make, and required
libraries) detailed below under [Source installation].
The conda installation is designed so one can use the R or Python
bindings to CmdStan seamlessly. Additionally, it provides the command
`cmdstan_model` to activate the CmdStan makefile from anywhere.

_Note_: This requires that conda has been installed already on your machine.
You can either install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), a free, minimal installer for conda
or you can get the full [Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/) system
which provides graphical installer wizards for [MacOS](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#macos)
and [Windows](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#windows) users.

We recommend installing CmdStan in a new conda environment:

```
 conda create -n stan -c conda-forge cmdstan
```

This command creates a new conda environment named `stan` and
downloads and installs the `cmdstan` package
as well as CmdStan and the required C++ toolchain.

To install into an existing conda environment, use the conda `install` command instead of `create`:

```
 conda install -c conda-forge cmdstan
```

Whichever installation method you use, afterwards you must
activate the new environment or deactivate/activate the existing one.
For example, if you installed cmdstan into a new environment `stan`,
run the command

```
 conda activate stan
```

By default, the latest release of CmdStan is installed.
If you require a specific release of CmdStan, CmdStan versions
2.26.1 and *newer* can be installed by specifying
`cmdstan==VERSION` in the install command.
For example to install an earlier version of CmdStan into your current
conda environment, run the following command, then re-activate the environment

```
conda install -c conda-forge cmdstan=2.27.0
```

### CmdStan install location under conda

A Conda environment is a directory that contains a specific collection of Conda packages.
To see the locations of your conda environments, use the command

```
 conda info -e
```

The shell environment variable `CONDA_PREFIX` points to the active conda environment (if any).
Both CmdStan and the C++ toolchain are installed into the
`bin` subdirectory of the conda environment directory, i.e.,
`$CONDA_PREFIX/bin/cmdstan` (Linux, MacOS), `%CONDA_PREFIX%\bin\cmdstan` (Windows).


Please report conda-specific install problems directly to the
conda-forge issue tracker,
[here](https://github.com/conda-forge/cmdstan-feedstock/issues).


## Installation from GitHub

Installation from GitHub consists of the following steps:

- Verify that you have a modern C++ toolchain.
See the [C++ Toolchain](#cpp-toolchain) section for details.

- Download the CmdStan source code from GitHub

- Build the CmdStan libraries and executables

- Check the installation by compiling and running the CmdStan example model `bernoulli.stan`.

### Downloading the source code

The GitHub source code is divided into sub-modules, each in its own repository.
The CmdStan repo contains just the `cmdstan` module;
the Stan inference engine algorithms and Stan math library functions
are specified as [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
and stored in the GitHub repositories
[stan](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan) and [math](https://github.com/stan-dev/math),
respectively.

A [CmdStan release](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan/releases) is
compressed tarfile which contains CmdStan and the Stan and math library submodules.
The most recent CmdStan release is always available as https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan/releases/latest.
A CmdStan release is versioned by major, minor, patch numbers, e.g., "2.29.2". Please ensure you download
a tarfile which is named "cmdstan-<version-number" rather than using the "Source Code" links at the bottom of
the release. These are automatically generated by GitHub and do **not** contain the required submodules.
The release tarfile unpacks into a directory named "cmdstan-<version number>",
e.g. "cmdstan-2.29.2".


By cloning the CmdStan repository with argument `--recursive`,
Git automatically initializes and updates each submodule in the repository,
including nested submodules if any of the submodules
in the repository have submodules themselves.
The following command will download the source code from the current
development branch of CmdStan into a directory named `cmdstan`:

```
> git clone https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan.git --recursive
```

Throughout this manual, we refer to this top-level CmdStan source directory as **`<cmdstan-home>`**.
This directory contains the following subdirectories:

- directory `cmdstan/stan` contains the sub-module `stan` (https://github.com/stan-dev/stan)
- directory `cmdstan/stan/lib/stan_math` contains the sub-module `math` (https://github.com/stan-dev/math)

### Building CmdStan

Building CmdStan involves preparing a set of executable programs
and compiling the command line interface and supporting libraries.
The CmdStan tools are:

- `stanc`: the Stan compiler (translates Stan language to C++).

- `stansummary`: a basic posterior analysis tool.
The `stansummary` utility processes one or more output files from a run
or set of runs of Stan's HMC sampler.
For all parameters and quantities of interest in the Stan program,
`stansummary` reports a set of statistics including mean, standard deviation,
percentiles, effective number of samples, and $\hat{R}$ values.

- `diagnose`: a basic sampler diagnostic tool which checks for indications
that the HMC sampler was unable to sample from the full posterior.

CmdStan releases include pre-built binaries of the Stan language
compiler (https://github.com/stan-dev/stanc3):
`bin/linux-stanc`, `bin/mac-stanc` and
`bin/windows-stanc`. The CmdStan makefile `build` task
copies the appropriate binary to `bin/stanc`. For CmdStan
installations which have been cloned of downloaded from the CmdStan
GitHub repository, the makefile task will download the appropriate
OS-specific binary from the stanc3 repository's nightly release.

Steps to build CmdStan:

- Open a command-line terminal window and change directories to the CmdStan home directory.

- Run the makefile target `build` which instantiates the CmdStan utilities
and compiles all necessary C++ libraries.

```
> cd <cmdstan-home>
> make build    # on Windows use mingw32-make
```

If your computer has multiple cores and sufficient ram, the build process
can be parallelized by providing the `-j` option. For example, to build on 4 cores, type:
```
> make -j4 build    # on Windows use mingw32-make
```

When `make build` is successful, the directory `<cmdstan-home>/bin/`
will contain the executables `stanc`, `stansummary`, and `diagnose` (on Windows, corresponding `.exe` files)
and the final lines of console output will show the version of CmdStan
that has just been built, e.g.:
```
--- CmdStan v2.29.2 built ---
```

**Warning:**  _The Make program may take 10+ minutes and consume 2+ GB of memory to build CmdStan._

**Windows only:** CmdStan requires that the Intel TBB library,
which is built by the above command, can be found by the Windows system.
This requires that the directory
`<cmdstan-home>/stan/lib/stan_math/lib/tbb` is part of the
`PATH` environment variable.
See [these instructions](https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/)
for details on changing the `PATH`.
To permanently make this setting for the current user, you may execute:
```
> mingw32-make install-tbb
```
After changing the `PATH` environment variable, you must open an new shell
in order for the new environment variable settings to take effect.
(This is not necessary on Mac and Linux systems because they can use the
absolute path to the Intel TBB library when linking into Stan programs.)


## Checking the Stan compiler

To check that the CmdStan installation is complete
and in working order, run the following series of commands
from the folder which CmdStan was installed.

On Linux and macOS:

```
# compile the example
> make examples/bernoulli/bernoulli

# fit to provided data (results of 10 trials, 2 out of 10 successes)
> ./examples/bernoulli/bernoulli sample data file=examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.data.json

# default output written to file `output.csv`,
# default num_samples is 1000, output file should have approx. 1050 lines
> ls -l output.csv

# run the `bin/stansummary utility to summarize parameter estimates
> bin/stansummary output.csv
```

On Windows:

```
# compile the example
> mingw32-make examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.exe

# fit to provided data (results of 10 trials, 2 out of 10 successes)
> ./examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.exe sample data file=examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.data.json

# run the `bin/stansummary.exe utility to summarize parameter estimates
> bin/stansummary.exe output.csv
```

The sample data in file `bernoulli.json.data` specifies 2 out of 10 successes, therefore
the range `mean(theta)`$\pm$`sd(theta)` should include 0.2.


## Troubleshooting the installation

Updates to CmdStan, changes in compiler options, or updates to the
C++ toolchain may result in errors when trying to compile a Stan program.
Often, these problems can be resolved by removing the existing CmdStan binaries
and recompiling.  To do this, you must run the makefile commands
from the `<cmdstan-home>` directory:

```
> cd <cmdstan-home>
> make clean-all    # on Windows use mingw32-make
> make build
```


### Common problems

This section contains solutions to problems reported on https://discourse.mc-stan.org

**Compiler error message about PCH file**

To speed up compilation, the Stan makefile pre-compiles parts of the core Stan library.
If these pre-compiled files are out of sync with the compiled model, the compiler will complain, e.g.:

```
error: PCH file uses an older PCH format that is no longer supported
```

In this case, clean and rebuild CmdStan, as shown in the previous section.


**Windows: 'mingw32-make' is not recognised**

If the C++ toolchain has been installed but not properly registered,
then the call to `mingw32-make` will result in error message:
```
'mingw32-make' is not recognised as an internal or external command
```
To fix this, ensure you have followed the steps for adding the toolchain to your
`PATH` and installing the additional utilities covered in the
[configuration instructions](#windows)


**Windows: 'g++' or 'cut' is not recognized**

The CmdStan makefile uses a few shell utilities which might not be present in Windows,
resulting in the error message:
```
'cut' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
```
To fix this, ensure you have followed the steps for adding the toolchain to your
`PATH` and installing the additional utilities covered in the
[configuration instructions](#windows)

**Spaces in paths to CmdStan or model**

Both `make` and `mingw32-make` can fail when dealing with files in folders
with a space somewhere in their file path. Particularly on Windows, this can
be an issue when CmdStan, or the models you are trying to build, are placed in
the `One Drive` folder.

Unfortunately, the errors created by this situation are not alwas informative.
Some errors you may see are:

```
mingw32-make: *** INTERNAL: readdir: Invalid argument
```
```
make: *** [make/program:50: x.hpp] Error 2
```

If the (fully-expanded) folder path to CmdStan or the model you are trying to
build contains a space, we recommend trying a different location if you encounter
any issues during building.


## C++ Toolchain {#cpp-toolchain}

Compiling a Stan program requires a modern C++ compiler and the GNU Make build utility (a.k.a. "gmake").
These vary by operating system.

#### Linux

The required C++ compiler is `g++ 4.9 3`.
On most systems the GNU Make utility is pre-installed and is the default `make` utility.
There is usually a pre-installed C++ compiler as well, however, it may not be new enough.
To check, run commands:

```
g++ --version
make --version
```

If these are at least at `g++` version 4.9.3 or later and
`make` version 3.81 or later, no additional installations are
necessary. It may still be desirable to update the C++ compiler
`g++`, because later versions are faster.

To install the latest version of these tools (or upgrade an older
version), use the following commands or their equivalent for your
distribution, install via the commands:

```
sudo apt install g++
sudo apt install make
```

If you can't run `sudo`, you will need to ask your sysadmin
or cluster administrator to install these tools for you.


#### MacOS

To install a C++ development
environment on a Mac, use Apple's Xcode development environment
https://developer.apple.com/xcode/.

From the [Xcode home page](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
`View in Mac App Store`.

- From the App Store, click `Install`, enter an Apple ID, and wait
for Xcode to finish installing.
-  Open the Xcode application, click top-level menu `Preferences`,
click top-row button `Downloads`, click button for
`Components`, click on the `Install` button to the right of
the `Command Line Tools` entry, then wait for it to finish
installing.
- Click the top-level menu item `Xcode`, then click item `Quit
Xcode` to quit.

To test, open the Terminal application and enter:
```
clang++ --version
make --version
```

If you have installed XCode, but don't have `make`, you can install the
XCode command-line tools via command:
```
xcode-select --install
```



#### Windows {#windows}


The Windows toolchain consists of programs `g++`, the C++ compiler, and `mingw32-make`, the GNU Make utility.
To check if these are present,
open a command shell [^1]
and type:
```
g++ --version
mingw32-make --version
```

CmdStan is known compatible with the RTools40, RTools42, and RTools43 toolchains. These require slightly
different steps to configure, so please follow the appropriate steps below. All toolchains will require
updating your `PATH` variable, See [these instructions](https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/)
for details on changing the `PATH` if you are unfamiliar. The following instructions will assume that the default installation
directory was used, so be sure to update the paths accordingly if you have chosen a different
directory.

##### RTools40

RTools40 provides both a standard `g++-8` toolchain and a `g++-10` Universal C Runtime (UCRT) toolchain.
Note the that newer `g++-10` UCRT toolchain is only available for 64-bit systems, whereas the `g++-8`
toolchain is available for both. Additionally the UCRT is only natively supported on Windows 10 and newer,
older systems will require a [Microsoft update](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows-c0514201-7fe6-95a3-b0a5-287930f3560c)

###### Installation

Download the [installer](https://github.com/r-windows/rtools-installer/releases/download/2022-02-06/rtools40-x86_64.exe)
and complete the prompts to install.

Next, you need to add the location of the toolchain to your `PATH` environment variable so that it
can be called from the command line. Add the following lines to your `PATH`:
```
C:\rtools40\usr\bin

# Add only one of the below
C:\rtools40\mingw32\bin   # 32-bit g++-8
C:\rtools40\mingw64\bin   # 64-bit g++-8
C:\rtools40\ucrt64\bin    # 64-bit g++-10 (UCRT)
```

CmdStan additionally needs the `mingw32-make` utility, which you can install using RTools.
Navigate to the installation directory (e.g., `C:\rtools40`) and launch the `msys2.exe` file.
Execute the appropriate command below to install `mingw32-make` for your selected toolchain:
```
pacman -Sy mingw-w64-i686-make            # 32-bit g++-8
pacman -Sy mingw-w64-x86_64-make          # 64-bit g++-8
pacman -Sy mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-make     # 64-bit g++-10 (UCRT)
```

##### RTools42 & RTools43

Both RTools42 & RTools43 provide 64-bit UCRT toolchains, where RTools42 provides g++-10 and
RTools43 provides g++-12. The installation/configuration is identical for both toolchains.

###### Installation

Download the installer for your preferred toolchain and complete the prompts for installation:

 - [RTools42](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools42/files/rtools42-5355-5357.exe)
 - [RTools43](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools43/files/rtools43-5863-5818.exe)

Next, you need to add the toolchain directory to your `PATH` variable. Add the appropriate lines
from below:
```
# RTools42
C:\rtools42\usr\bin
C:\rtools42\ucrt64\bin

# RTools43
C:\rtools43\usr\bin
C:\rtools43\ucrt64\bin
```

Next, you need to install the `mingw32-make` utility and some additional compiler dependencies.
Navigate to the installation directory of the toolchain and launch the `msys2.exe` file.
Execute the below commands to install the needed dependencies:
```
pacman -Sy mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-make mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc
```

__32-bit Builds__

CmdStan defaults to a 64-bit build. On a 32-bit operating system, you must specify
the make variable `BIT=32` as part of the `make` command, described in the next section.

[^1]:
To open a Windows command shell, first open the __Start Menu__,
(usually in the lower left of the screen), select option __All Programs__,
then option __Accessories__, then program __Command Prompt__.
Alternatively, enter `[Windows+r]` (both keys together on the
keyboard), and enter `cmd` into the text field that pops up in the Run window,
then press `[Return]` on the keyboard to run.


## Using GNU Make {#gnu-make}

CmdStan relies on the GNU Make utility to build both the
Stan model executables and the CmdStan tools.

GNU Make builds executable programs and libraries from source code by reading files
called Makefiles which specify how to derive the target program.
A Makefile consists of a set of recursive rules where each rule
specifies a target, its dependencies,
and the specific operations required to build the target.
Specifying dependencies for a target provides a way to control
the build process so that targets which depend on other files will
be updated as needed _only_ when there are changes to those other files.
Thus Make provides an efficient way to manage complex software.

The CmdStan Makefile is in the `<cmdstan-home>` directory
and is named `makefile`. This is one of the default
[GNU Makefile names](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Makefile-Names.html),
which allows you to omit the `-f makefile` argument to the Make command.
Because the CmdStan Makefile includes several other Makefiles,
**Make only works properly when invoked from the `<cmdstan-home>` directory**;
attempts to use this Makefile from another directory by specifying the
full path to the file `makefile` won't work.
For example, trying to call Make from another directory by specifying
the full path the the makefile results in the following set of error messages:

```
make -f ~/github/stan-dev/cmdstan/makefile
/Users/mitzi/github/stan-dev/cmdstan/makefile:58: make/stanc: No such file or directory
/Users/mitzi/github/stan-dev/cmdstan/makefile:59: make/program: No such file or directory
/Users/mitzi/github/stan-dev/cmdstan/makefile:60: make/tests: No such file or directory
/Users/mitzi/github/stan-dev/cmdstan/makefile:61: make/command: No such file or directory
make: *** No rule to make target `make/command'.  Stop.
```

The [conda-forge `cmdstan` package](#conda-install) provides a solution to this problem
via `cmdstan_model` command which lets you run the CmdStan makefile from anywhere
to compile a Stan model.

Makefile syntax allows general pattern rules based on file suffixes.
Stan programs must be stored in files with suffix `.stan`; the
CmdStan makefile rules specify how to transform the Stan source code
into a binary executable.
For example, to compile the Stan program `my_program.stan` in directory `../my_dir/`,
the make target is `../my_dir/my_program` or ` ../my_dir/my_program.exe` (on Windows).

To call Make, you invoke the utility name, either `make` or `mingw32-make`, followed by, in order:

- zero or more [Make program options](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Options-Summary.html), then specify any Make variables as a series of

- zero of more Make variables, described below

- zero or more _target_ names; the set of names is determined by the Makefile rules.

```
make <flags> <variables> <targets>
```


__Makefile Variables__

Make targets can be preceded by any number of Makefile variable name=value pairs.
For example, to compile `../my_dir/my_program.stan` for an OpenCL (GPU) machine,
set the makefile variable `STAN_OPENCL` to `TRUE`:
```
> make STAN_OPENCL=TRUE ../my_dir/my_program    # on Windows use mingw32-make
```
Makefile variables can also be set by creating a file named `local` in the
CmdStan `make` subdirectory which contains a list of `<VARIABLE>=<VALUE>` pairs,
one per line.   For example, if you are working on a 32-bit machine,
you would put the line `BIT=32` into the file `<cmdstan-home>/make/local`
so that all CmdStan programs and Stan models compile properly.

The complete set of Makefile variables can be found in file
`<cmdstan-home>/cmdstan/stan/lib/stan_math/make/compiler_flags`.

__Make Targets__

When invoked without any arguments at all, Make prints a help message:
```
> make    # on Windows use mingw32-make
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CmdStan v2.23.0 help

  Build CmdStan utilities:
    > make build

    This target will:
    1. Install the Stan compiler bin/stanc from stanc3 binaries.
    2. Build the print utility bin/print (deprecated; will be removed in v3.0)
    3. Build the stansummary utility bin/stansummary
    4. Build the diagnose utility bin/diagnose
    5. Build all libraries and object files compile and link an executable Stan program

    Note: to build using multiple cores, use the -j option to make, e.g.,
    for 4 cores:
    > make build -j4


  Build a Stan program:

    Given a Stan program at foo/bar.stan, build an executable by typing:
    > make foo/bar

    This target will:
    1. Install the Stan compiler (bin/stanc), as needed.
    2. Use the Stan compiler to generate C++ code, foo/bar.hpp.
    3. Compile the C++ code using cc . to generate foo/bar

  Additional make options:
    STANCFLAGS: defaults to "". These are extra options passed to bin/stanc
      when generating C++ code. If you want to allow undefined functions in the
      Stan program, either add this to make/local or the command line:
          STANCFLAGS = --allow_undefined
    USER_HEADER: when STANCFLAGS has --allow_undefined, this is the name of the
      header file that is included. This defaults to "user_header.hpp" in the
      directory of the Stan program.


  Example - bernoulli model: examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.stan

    1. Build the model:
       > make examples/bernoulli/bernoulli
    2. Run the model:
       > examples/bernoulli/bernoulli sample data file=examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.data.R
    3. Look at the samples:
       > bin/stansummary output.csv


  Clean CmdStan:

    Remove the built CmdStan tools:
    > make clean-all

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
