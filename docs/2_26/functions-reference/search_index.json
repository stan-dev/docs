["index.html", "Stan Functions Reference Overview", " Stan Functions Reference Version 2.26 Stan Development Team Overview This is the reference for the functions defined in the Stan math library and available in the Stan programming language. The Stan project comprises a domain-specific language for probabilistic programming, a differentiable mathematics and probability library, algorithms for Bayesian posterior inference and posterior analysis, along with interfaces and analysis tools in all of the popular data analysis languages. In addition to this reference manual, there is a user’s guide and a language reference manual for the Stan language and algorithms. The Stan User’s Guide provides example models and programming techniques for coding statistical models in Stan. The Stan Reference Manual specifies the Stan programming language and inference algorithms. There is also a separate installation and getting started guide for each of the Stan interfaces (R, Python, Julia, Stata, MATLAB, Mathematica, and command line). Interfaces and platforms Stan runs under Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Stan uses a domain-specific programming language that is portable across data analysis languages. Stan has interfaces for R, Python, Julia, MATLAB, Mathematica, Stata, and the command line, as well as an alternative language interface in Scala. See the web site https://mc-stan.org for interface-specific links and getting started instructions Web site The official resource for all things related to Stan is the web site: https://mc-stan.org The web site links to all of the packages comprising Stan for both users and developers. This is the place to get started with Stan. Find the interface in the language you want to use and follow the download, installation, and getting started instructions. GitHub organization Stan’s source code and much of the developer process is hosted on GitHub. Stan’s organization is: https://github.com/stan-dev Each package has its own repository within the stan-dev organization. The web site is also hosted and managed through GitHub.

Logo: Stan logo usage guidelines Acknowledgements The Stan project could not exist without the generous grant funding of many grant agencies to the participants in the project. For more details of direct funding for the project, see the web site and project pages of the Stan developers. The Stan project could also not exist without the generous contributions of its users in reporting and in many cases fixing bugs in the code and its documentation. We used to try to list all of those who contributed patches and bug reports for the manual here, but when that number passed into the hundreds, it became too difficult to manage reliably. Instead, we will defer to GitHub (link above), where all contributions to the project are made and tracked. Finally, we should all thank the Stan developers, without whom this project could not exist. We used to try and list the developers here, but like the bug reporters, once the list grew into the dozens, it became difficult to track. Instead, we will defer to the Stan web page and GitHub itself for a list of core developers and all developer contributions respectively. "],

["void-functions.html", "1 Void Functions", " 1 Void Functions Stan does not technically support functions that do not return values. It does support two types of statements, one printing and one for rejecting outputs. Although print and reject appear to have the syntax of functions, they are actually special kinds of statements with slightly different form and behavior than other functions. First, they are the constructs that allow a variable number of arguments. Second, they are the the only constructs to accept string literals (e.g., \"hello world\") as arguments. Third, they have no effect on the log density function and operate solely through side effects. The special keyword void is used for their return type because they behave like variadic functions with void return type, even though they are special kinds of statements.

["int-arithmetic.html", "2.1 Integer-valued arithmetic operators", " 2.1 Integer-valued arithmetic operators Stan’s arithmetic is based on standard double-precision C++ integer and floating-point arithmetic. If the arguments to an arithmetic operator are both integers, as in 2 + 2, integer arithmetic is used. If one argument is an integer and the other a floating-point value, as in 2.0 + 2 and 2 + 2.0, then the integer is promoted to a floating point value and floating-point arithmetic is used. Integer arithmetic behaves slightly differently than floating point arithmetic. The first difference is how overflow is treated. If the sum or product of two integers overflows the maximum integer representable, the result is an undesirable wraparound behavior at the bit level. If the integers were first promoted to real numbers, they would not overflow a floating-point representation. There are no extra checks in Stan to flag overflows, so it is up to the user to make sure it does not occur. Secondly, because the set of integers is not closed under division and there is no special infinite value for integers, integer division implicitly rounds the result. If both arguments are positive, the result is rounded down. For example, 1 / 2 evaluates to 0 and 5 / 3 evaluates to 1. If one of the integer arguments to division is negative, the latest C++ specification ( C++11), requires rounding toward zero. This would have 1 / 2 and -1 / 2 evaluate to 0, -7 / 2 evaluate to -3, and 7 / 2 evaluate to 3. Before the C++11 specification, the behavior was platform dependent, allowing rounding up or down. All compilers recent enough to be able to deal with Stan’s templating should follow the C++11 specification, but it may be worth testing if you are not sure and plan to use integer division with negative values. Unlike floating point division, where 1.0 / 0.0 produces the special positive infinite value, integer division by zero, as in 1 / 0, has undefined behavior in the C++ standard. For example, the clang++ compiler on Mac OS X returns 3764, whereas the g++ compiler throws an exception and aborts the program with a warning. As with overflow, it is up to the user to make sure integer divide-by-zero does not occur. 2.1.1 Binary infix operators Operators are described using the C++ syntax. For instance, the binary operator of addition, written X + Y, would have the Stan signature int operator+(int,int) indicating it takes two real arguments and returns a real value. As noted previously, the value of integer division is platform-dependent when rounding is platform dependent before C++11; the descriptions below provide the C++11 definition. int operator+(int x, int y) The sum of the addends x and y \\[ \\text{operator+}(x,y) = (x + y) \\] int operator-(int x, int y) The difference between the minuend x and subtrahend y \\[ \\text{operator-}(x,y) = (x - y) \\] int operator*(int x, int y) The product of the factors x and y \\[ \\text{operator*}(x,y) = (x \\times y) \\] int operator/(int x, int y) The integer quotient of the dividend x and divisor y \\[ \\text{operator/}(x,y) = \\begin{cases} \\lfloor x / y \\rfloor &amp; \\text{if } x / y \\geq 0 \\\\ - \\lfloor \\text{floor}(-x / y) \\rfloor &amp; \\text{if } x / y &lt; 0. \\end{cases} \\] int operator%(int x, int y) x modulo y, which is the positive remainder after dividing x by y.

["fun-vectorization.html", "3.1 Vectorization of real-valued functions", " 3.1 Vectorization of real-valued functions Although listed in this chapter, many of Stan’s built-in functions are vectorized so that they may be applied to any argument type. The vectorized form of these functions is not any faster than writing an explicit loop that iterates over the elements applying the function—it’s just easier to read and write and less error prone. 3.1.1 Unary function vectorization Many of Stan’s unary functions can be applied to any argument type. For example, the exponential function, exp, can be applied to real arguments or arrays of real arguments. Other than for integer arguments, the result type is the same as the argument type, including dimensionality and size. Integer arguments are first promoted to real values, but the result will still have the same dimensionality and size as the argument. 3.1.1.1 Real and real array arguments When applied to a simple real value, the result is a real value. When applied to arrays, vectorized functions like exp() are defined elementwise. For example, // declare some variables for arguments real x0; real x1[5]; real x2[4, 7]; ... // declare some variables for results real y0; real y1[5]; real y2[4, 7]; ... // calculate and assign results y0 = exp(x0); y1 = exp(x1); y2 = exp(x2); When exp is applied to an array, it applies elementwise. For example, the statement above, y2 = exp(x2); produces the same result for y2 as the explicit loop for (i in 1:4) for (j in 1:7) y2[i, j] = exp(x2[i, j]); 3.1.1.2 Vector and matrix arguments Vectorized functions also apply elementwise to vectors and matrices. For example, vector[5] xv; row_vector[7] xrv; matrix[10, 20] xm; vector[5] yv; row_vector[7] yrv; matrix[10, 20] ym; yv = exp(xv); yrv = exp(xrv); ym = exp(xm); Arrays of vectors and matrices work the same way. For example, matrix[17, 93] u[12]; matrix[17, 93] z[12]; z = exp(u); After this has been executed, z[i, j, k] will be equal to exp(u[i, j, k]). 3.1.1.3 Integer and integer array arguments Integer arguments are promoted to real values in vectorized unary functions. Thus if n is of type int, exp(n) is of type real. Arrays work the same way, so that if n2 is a one dimensional array of integers, then exp(n2) will be a one-dimensional array of reals with the same number of elements as n2. For example, int n1[23]; real z1[23]; z1 = exp(n1); It would be illegal to try to assign exp(n1) to an array of integers; the return type is a real array. 3.1.2 Binary function vectorization Like the unary functions, many of Stan’s binary functions have been vectorized, and can be applied elementwise to combinations of both scalars or container types. 3.1.2.1 Scalar and scalar array arguments When applied to two scalar values, the result is a scalar value. When applied to two arrays, or combination of a scalar value and an array, vectorized functions like pow() are defined elementwise. For example, // declare some variables for arguments real x00; real x01; real x10[5]; real x11[5]; real x20[4, 7]; real x21[4, 7]; ... // declare some variables for results real y0; real y1[5]; real y2[4, 7]; ... // calculate and assign results y0 = pow(x00, x01); y1 = pow(x10, x11); y2 = pow(x20, x21); When pow is applied to two arrays, it applies elementwise. For example, the statement above, y2 = pow(x20, x21); produces the same result for y2 as the explicit loop for (i in 1:4) for (j in 1:7) y2[i, j] = pow(x20[i, j], x21[i, j]); Alternatively, if a combination of an array and a scalar are provided, the scalar value is broadcast to be applied to each value of the array. For example, the following statement: y2 = pow(x20, x00); produces the same result for y2 as the explicit loop: for (i in 1:4) for (j in 1:7) y2[i, j] = pow(x20[i, j], x00); 3.1.2.2 Vector and matrix arguments Vectorized binary functions also apply elementwise to vectors and matrices, and to combinations of these with scalar values. For example, real x00; vector[5] xv00; vector[5] xv01; row_vector[7] xrv; matrix[10, 20] xm; vector[5] yv; row_vector[7] yrv; matrix[10, 20] ym; yv = pow(xv00, xv01); yrv = pow(xrv, x00); ym = pow(x00, xm); Arrays of vectors and matrices work the same way. For example, matrix[17, 93] u[12]; matrix[17, 93] z[12]; z = pow(u, x00); After this has been executed, z[i, j, k] will be equal to pow(u[i, j, k], x00). 3.1.2.3 Input &amp; return types Vectorised binary functions require that both inputs, unless one is a real, be containers of the same type and size. For example, the following statements are legal: vector[5] xv; row_vector[7] xrv; matrix[10, 20] xm; vector[5] yv = pow(xv, xv) row_vector[7] yrv = pow(xrv, xrv) matrix[10, 20] = pow(xm, xm) But the following statements are not: vector[5] xv; vector[7] xv2; row_vector[5] xrv; // Cannot mix different types vector[5] yv = pow(xv, xrv) // Cannot mix different sizes of the same type vector[5] yv = pow(xv, xv2) While the vectorized binary functions generally require the same input types, the only exception to this is for binary functions that require one input to be an integer and the other to be a real (e.g., bessel_first_kind). For these functions, one argument can be a container of any type while the other can be an integer array, as long as the dimensions of both are the same. For example, the following statements are legal: vector[5] xv; matrix[5, 5] xm; int xi[5]; int xii[5, 5]; vector[5] yv = bessel_first_kind(xi, xv); matrix[5, 5] ym = bessel_first_kind(xii, xm); Whereas these are not: vector[5] xv; matrix[5, 5] xm; int xi[7]; // Dimensions of containers do not match vector[5] yv = bessel_first_kind(xi, xv); // Function requires first argument be an integer type matrix[5, 5] ym = bessel_first_kind(xm, xm); "],

["get-log-prob.html", "3.4 Log probability function", " 3.4 Log probability function The basic purpose of a Stan program is to compute a log probability function and its derivatives. The log probability function in a Stan model outputs the log density on the unconstrained scale. A log probability accumulator starts at zero and is then incremented in various ways by a Stan program. The variables are first transformed from unconstrained to constrained, and the log Jacobian determinant added to the log probability accumulator. Then the model block is executed on the constrained parameters, with each sampling statement (~) and log probability increment statement (increment_log_prob) adding to the accumulator. At the end of the model block execution, the value of the log probability accumulator is the log probability value returned by the Stan program. Stan provides a special built-in function target() that takes no arguments and returns the current value of the log probability accumulator.1 This function is primarily useful for debugging purposes, where for instance, it may be used with a print statement to display the log probability accumulator at various stages of execution to see where it becomes ill defined. real target() Return the current value of the log probability accumulator. real get_lp() Return the current value of the log probability accumulator; deprecated; - use target() instead. Both target and the deprecated get_lp act like other functions ending in _lp, meaning that they may only may only be used in the model block. This function used to be called get_lp(), but that name has been deprecated; using it will print a warning. The function get_lp() will be removed in a future release.↩ "],

Stan supports the usual boolean comparison operations and boolean operators. These all have the same syntax and precedence as in C++; for the full list of operators and precedences, see the reference manual. 3.5.1 Comparison operators All comparison operators return boolean values, either 0 or 1. Each operator has two signatures, one for integer comparisons and one for floating-point comparisons. Comparing an integer and real value is carried out by first promoting the integer value. int operator&lt;(int x, int y) int operator&lt;(real x, real y) Return 1 if x is less than y and 0 otherwise. \\[ \\text{operator&lt;}(x,y) = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{if $x &lt; y$} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\] int operator&lt;=(int x, int y) int operator&lt;=(real x, real y) Return 1 if x is less than or equal y and 0 otherwise. \\[ \\text{operator&lt;=}(x,y) = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{if $x \\leq y$} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\] int operator&gt;(int x, int y) int operator&gt;(real x, real y) Return 1 if x is greater than y and 0 otherwise. \\[ \\text{operator&gt;} = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{if $x &gt; y$} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\] int operator&gt;=(int x, int y) int operator&gt;=(real x, real y) Return 1 if x is greater than or equal to y and 0 otherwise. \\[ \\text{operator&gt;=} = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{if $x \\geq y$} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\] int operator==(int x, int y) int operator==(real x, real y) Return 1 if x is equal to y and 0 otherwise. \\[ \\text{operator==}(x,y) = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{if $x = y$} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\] int operator!=(int x, int y) int operator!=(real x, real y) Return 1 if x is not equal to y and 0 otherwise. \\[ \\text{operator!=}(x,y) = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{if $x \\neq y$} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\] 3.5.2 Boolean operators Boolean operators return either 0 for false or 1 for true. Inputs may be any real or integer values, with non-zero values being treated as true and zero values treated as false. These operators have the usual precedences, with negation (not) binding the most tightly, conjunction the next and disjunction the weakest; all of the operators bind more tightly than the comparisons. Thus an expression such as !a &amp;&amp; b is interpreted as (!a) &amp;&amp; b, and a &lt; b || c &gt;= d &amp;&amp; e != f as (a &lt; b) || (((c &gt;= d) &amp;&amp; (e != f))). int operator!(int x) int operator!(real x) Return 1 if x is zero and 0 otherwise. \\[ \\text{operator!}(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 &amp; \\text{if $x \\neq 0$} \\\\ 1 &amp; \\text{if $x = 0$} \\end{cases} \\] int operator&amp;&amp;(int x, int y) int operator&amp;&amp;(real x, real y) Return 1 if x is unequal to 0 and y is unequal to 0. \\[ \\mathrm{operator\\&amp;\\&amp;}(x,y) = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{if $x \\neq 0$} \\text{ and } y \\neq 0\\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\] int operator||(int x, int y) int operator||(real x, real y) Return 1 if x is unequal to 0 or y is unequal to 0. \\[ \\text{operator||}(x,y) = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{if $x \\neq 0$} \\textrm{ or } y \\neq 0\\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\] 3.5.2.1 Boolean operator short circuiting Like in C++, the boolean operators &amp;&amp; and || and are implemented to short circuit directly to a return value after evaluating the first argument if it is sufficient to resolve the result. In evaluating a || b, if a evaluates to a value other than zero, the expression returns the value 1 without evaluating the expression b. Similarly, evaluating a &amp;&amp; b first evaluates a, and if the result is zero, returns 0 without evaluating b. 3.5.3 Logical functions The logical functions introduce conditional behavior functionally and are primarily provided for compatibility with BUGS and JAGS. real step(real x) Return 1 if x is positive and 0 otherwise. \\[ \\text{step}(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 &amp; \\text{if } x &lt; 0 \\\\ 1 &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\] Warning: int_step(0) and int_step(NaN) return 0 whereas step(0) and step(NaN) return 1.

Care must be taken because both of these indicator functions are step-like and thus can cause discontinuities in gradients when applied to parameters; see section step-like functions for details. "],

["array-size-and-dimension-function.html", "4.2 Array size and dimension function", " 4.2 Array size and dimension function The size of an array or matrix can be obtained using the dims() function. The dims() function is defined to take an argument consisting of any variable with up to 8 array dimensions (and up to 2 additional matrix dimensions) and returns an array of integers with the dimensions. For example, if two variables are declared as follows, real x[7,8,9]; matrix[8,9] y[7]; then calling dims(x) or dims(y) returns an integer array of size 3 containing the elements 7, 8, and 9 in that order. The size() function extracts the number of elements in an array. This is just the top-level elements, so if the array is declared as real a[M,N]; the size of a is M. The function num_elements, on the other hand, measures all of the elements, so that the array a above has \\(M \\times N\\) elements. The specialized functions rows() and cols() should be used to extract the dimensions of vectors and matrices. int[] dims(T x) Return an integer array containing the dimensions of x; the type of the argument T can be any Stan type with up to 8 array dimensions. int num_elements(T[] x) Return the total number of elements in the array x including all elements in contained arrays, vectors, and matrices. T can be any array type.

T[,] rep_array(T x, int m, int n) Return the m by n array with every entry assigned to x. T[,,] rep_array(T x, int k, int m, int n) Return the k by m by n array with every entry assigned to x.

There are specialized forms for lower triangular matrices and for symmetric, positive-definite matrices. 5.14.1.1 Matrix division operators row_vector operator/(row_vector b, matrix A) The right division of b by A; equivalently b * inverse(A) matrix operator/(matrix B, matrix A) The right division of B by A; equivalently B * inverse(A) vector operator\\(matrix A, vector b) The left division of A by b; equivalently inverse(A) * b matrix operator\\(matrix A, matrix B) The left division of A by B; equivalently inverse(A) * B 5.14.1.2 Lower-triangular matrix division functions There are four division functions which use lower triangular views of a matrix. The lower triangular view of a matrix \\(\\text{tri}(A)\\) is used in the definitions and defined by \\[ \\text{tri}(A)[m,n] = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} A[m,n] &amp; \\text{if } m \\geq n, \\text{ and} \\\\[4pt] 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise}. \\end{array} \\right. \\] When a lower triangular view of a matrix is used, the elements above the diagonal are ignored. vector mdivide_left_tri_low(matrix A, vector b) The left division of b by a lower-triangular view of A; algebraically equivalent to the less efficient and stable form inverse(tri(A)) * b, where tri(A) is the lower-triangular portion of A with the above-diagonal entries set to zero. matrix mdivide_left_tri_low(matrix A, matrix B) The left division of B by a triangular view of A; algebraically equivalent to the less efficient and stable form inverse(tri(A)) * B, where tri(A) is the lower-triangular portion of A with the above-diagonal entries set to zero. row_vector mdivide_right_tri_low(row_vector b, matrix A) The right division of b by a triangular view of A; algebraically equivalent to the less efficient and stable form b * inverse(tri(A)), where tri(A) is the lower-triangular portion of A with the above-diagonal entries set to zero. matrix mdivide_right_tri_low(matrix B, matrix A) The right division of B by a triangular view of A; algebraically equivalent to the less efficient and stable form B * inverse(tri(A)), where tri(A) is the lower-triangular portion of A with the above-diagonal entries set to zero. 5.14.2 Symmetric positive-definite matrix division functions There are four division functions which are specialized for efficiency and stability for symmetric positive-definite matrix dividends. If the matrix dividend argument is not symmetric and positive definite, these will reject and print warnings. matrix mdivide_left_spd(matrix A, vector b) The left division of b by the symmetric, positive-definite matrix A; algebraically equivalent to the less efficient and stable form inverse(A) * b. vector mdivide_left_spd(matrix A, matrix B) The left division of B by the symmetric, positive-definite matrix A; algebraically equivalent to the less efficient and stable form inverse(A) * B. row_vector mdivide_right_spd(row_vector b, matrix A) The right division of b by the symmetric, positive-definite matrix A; algebraically equivalent to the less efficient and stable form b * inverse(A). matrix mdivide_right_spd(matrix B, matrix A) The right division of B by the symmetric, positive-definite matrix A; algebraically equivalent to the less efficient and stable form B * inverse(A). 5.14.3 Matrix exponential The exponential of the matrix \\(A\\) is formally defined by the convergent power series: \\[ e^A = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{A^n}{n!} \\] matrix matrix_exp(matrix A) The matrix exponential of A matrix matrix_exp_multiply(matrix A, matrix B) The multiplication of matrix exponential of A and matrix B; algebraically equivalent to the less efficient form matrix_exp(A) * B. matrix scale_matrix_exp_multiply(real t, matrix A, matrix B) The multiplication of matrix exponential of tA and matrix B; algebraically equivalent to the less efficient form matrix_exp(t * A) * B. 5.14.4 Matrix power Returns the nth power of the specific matrix: \\[ M^n = M_1 * ... * M_n \\] matrix matrix_power(matrix A, int B) Matrix A raised to the power B. 5.14.5 Linear algebra functions 5.14.5.1 Trace real trace(matrix A) The trace of A, or 0 if A is empty; A is not required to be diagonal 5.14.5.2 Determinants real determinant(matrix A) The determinant of A real log_determinant(matrix A) The log of the absolute value of the determinant of A 5.14.5.3 Inverses It is almost never a good idea to use matrix inverses directly because they are both inefficient and arithmetically unstable compared to the alternatives. Rather than inverting a matrix m and post-multiplying by a vector or matrix a, as in inverse(m) * a, it is better to code this using matrix division, as in m \\ a. The pre-multiplication case is similar, with b * inverse(m) being more efficiently coded as as b / m. There are also useful special cases for triangular and symmetric, positive-definite matrices that use more efficient solvers. Warning: The function inv(m) is the elementwise inverse function, which returns 1 / m[i, j] for each element. matrix inverse(matrix A) The inverse of A matrix inverse_spd(matrix A) The inverse of A where A is symmetric, positive definite. This version is faster and more arithmetically stable when the input is symmetric and positive definite. 5.14.5.4 Generalized Inverse The generalized inverse \\(M^+\\) of a matrix \\(M\\) is a matrix that satisfies \\(M M^+ M = M\\). For an invertible, square matrix \\(M\\), \\(M^+\\) is equivalent to \\(M^{-1}\\). The dimensions of \\(M^+\\) are equivalent to the dimensions of \\(M^T\\). The generalized inverse exists for any matrix, so the \\(M\\) may be singular or less than full rank. Even though the generalized inverse exists for any arbitrary matrix, the derivatives of this function only exist on matrices of locally constant rank (Golub and Pereyra 1973), meaning, the derivatives do not exist if small perturbations make the matrix change rank. For example, considered the rank of the matrix \\(A\\) as a function of \\(\\epsilon\\): \\[ A = \\left( \\begin{array}{cccc} 1 + \\epsilon &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 2 \\end{array} \\right) \\] When \\(\\epsilon = 0\\), \\(A\\) is rank 1 because the second row is twice the first (and so there is only one linearly independent row). If \\(\\epsilon \\neq 0\\), the rows are no longer linearly dependent, and the matrix is rank 2. This matrix does not have locally constant rank at \\(\\epsilon = 0\\), and so the derivatives do not exist at zero. Because HMC depends on the derivatives existing, this lack of differentiability creates undefined behavior. matrix generalized_inverse(matrix A) The generalized inverse of A 5.14.5.5 Eigendecomposition vector eigenvalues_sym(matrix A) The vector of eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix A in ascending order matrix eigenvectors_sym(matrix A) The matrix with the (column) eigenvectors of symmetric matrix A in the same order as returned by the function eigenvalues_sym Because multiplying an eigenvector by \\(-1\\) results in an eigenvector, eigenvectors returned by a decomposition are only identified up to a sign change. In order to compare the eigenvectors produced by Stan’s eigendecomposition to others, signs may need to be normalized in some way, such as by fixing the sign of a component, or doing comparisons allowing a multiplication by \\(-1\\). The condition number of a symmetric matrix is defined to be the ratio of the largest eigenvalue to the smallest eigenvalue. Large condition numbers lead to difficulty in numerical algorithms such as computing inverses, and thus known as “ill conditioned.” The ratio can even be infinite in the case of singular matrices (i.e., those with eigenvalues of 0). 5.14.5.6 QR decomposition matrix qr_thin_Q(matrix A) The orthogonal matrix in the thin QR decomposition of A, which implies that the resulting matrix has the same dimensions as A matrix qr_thin_R(matrix A) The upper triangular matrix in the thin QR decomposition of A, which implies that the resulting matrix is square with the same number of columns as A matrix qr_Q(matrix A) The orthogonal matrix in the fat QR decomposition of A, which implies that the resulting matrix is square with the same number of rows as A matrix qr_R(matrix A) The upper trapezoidal matrix in the fat QR decomposition of A, which implies that the resulting matrix will be rectangular with the same dimensions as A The thin QR decomposition is always preferable because it will consume much less memory when the input matrix is large than will the fat QR decomposition. Both versions of the decomposition represent the input matrix as \\[ A = Q \\, R. \\] Multiplying a column of an orthogonal matrix by \\(-1\\) still results in an orthogonal matrix, and you can multiply the corresponding row of the upper trapezoidal matrix by \\(-1\\) without changing the product. Thus, Stan adopts the normalization that the diagonal elements of the upper trapezoidal matrix are strictly positive and the columns of the orthogonal matrix are reflected if necessary. Also, these QR decomposition algorithms do not utilize pivoting and thus may be numerically unstable on input matrices that have less than full rank. 5.14.5.7 Cholesky decomposition Every symmetric, positive-definite matrix (such as a correlation or covariance matrix) has a Cholesky decomposition. If \\(\\Sigma\\) is a symmetric, positive-definite matrix, its Cholesky decomposition is the lower-triangular vector \\(L\\) such that \\[ \\Sigma = L \\, L^{\\top}. \\] matrix cholesky_decompose(matrix A) The lower-triangular Cholesky factor of the symmetric positive-definite matrix A 5.14.5.8 Singular value decomposition The matrix A can be decomposed into a diagonal matrix of singular values, D, and matrices of its left and right singular vectors, U and V, \\[ A = U D V^T. \\] The matrices of singular vectors here are thin. That is for an \\(N\\) by \\(P\\) input A, \\(M = min(N, P)\\), U is size \\(N\\) by \\(M\\) and V is size \\(P\\) by \\(M\\). vector singular_values(matrix A) The singular values of A in descending order vector svd_U(matrix A) The left-singular vectors of A vector svd_V(matrix A) The right-singular vectors of A References "],

["sparse-matrices.html", "6 Sparse Matrix Operations", " 6 Sparse Matrix Operations For sparse matrices, for which many elements are zero, it is more efficient to use specialized representations to save memory and speed up matrix arithmetic (including derivative calculations). Given Stan’s implementation, there is substantial space (memory) savings by using sparse matrices. Because of the ease of optimizing dense matrix operations, speed improvements only arise at 90% or even greater sparsity; below that level, dense matrices are faster but use more memory. Because of this speedup and space savings, it may even be useful to read in a dense matrix and convert it to a sparse matrix before multiplying it by a vector. This chapter covers a very specific form of sparsity consisting of a sparse matrix multiplied by a dense vector. Compressed Row Storage Conversion Functions Sparse Matrix Arithmetic "],

The values \\((w(A), \\, v(A), \\, u(A))\\) are sufficient to reconstruct \\(A\\). The values are structured so that there is a real value and integer column index for each non-zero entry in the array, plus one integer for each row of the matrix, plus one for padding. There is also underlying storage for internal container pointers and sizes. The total memory usage is roughly \\(12 K + M\\) bytes plus a small constant overhead, which is often considerably fewer bytes than the \\(M \\times N\\) required to store a dense matrix. Even more importantly, zero values do not introduce derivatives under multiplication or addition, so many storage and evaluation steps are saved when sparse matrices are multiplied. "],

["functions-algebraic-solver.html", "9.1 Algebraic equation solver", " 9.1 Algebraic equation solver Stan provides two built-in algebraic equation solvers, respectively based on Powell’s and Newton’s methods. The Newton method constitutes a more recent addition to Stan; its use is recommended for most problems. Although they look like other function applications, algebraic solvers are special in two ways. First, an algebraic solver is a higher-order function, i.e. it takes another function as one of its arguments. Other functions in Stan which share this feature are the ordinary differential equation solvers (see section Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) Solvers). Ordinary Stan functions do not allow functions as arguments. Second, some of the arguments of the algebraic solvers are restricted to data only expressions. These expressions must not contain variables other than those declared in the data or transformed data blocks. Ordinary Stan functions place no restriction on the origin of variables in their argument expressions. 9.1.1 Specifying an algebraic equation as a function An algebraic system is specified as an ordinary function in Stan within the function block. The algebraic system function must have this signature: vector algebra_system(vector y, vector theta, real[] x_r, int[] x_i) The algebraic system function should return the value of the algebraic function which goes to 0, when we plug in the solution to the algebraic system. The argument of this function are: y, the unknowns we wish to solve for theta, parameter values used to evaluate the algebraic system x_r, data values used to evaluate the algebraic system x_i, integer data used to evaluate the algebraic system The algebraic system function separates parameter values, theta, from data values, x_r, for efficiency in propagating the derivatives through the algebraic system. 9.1.2 Call to the algebraic solver vector algebra_solver(function algebra_system, vector y_guess, vector theta, real[] x_r, int[] x_i) Solves the algebraic system, given an initial guess, using the Powell hybrid algorithm. vector algebra_solver(function algebra_system, vector y_guess, vector theta, real[] x_r, int[] x_i, real rel_tol, real f_tol, int max_steps) Solves the algebraic system, given an initial guess, using the Powell hybrid algorithm with additional control parameters for the solver. Note: In future releases, the function algebra_solver will be deprecated and replaced with algebra_solver_powell. vector algebra_solver_newton(function algebra_system, vector y_guess, vector theta, real[] x_r, int[] x_i) Solves the algebraic system, given an initial guess, using Newton’s method. vector algebra_solver_newton(function algebra_system, vector y_guess, vector theta, real[] x_r, int[] x_i, real rel_tol, real f_tol, int max_steps) Solves the algebraic system, given an initial guess, using Newton’s method with additional control parameters for the solver. 9.1.2.1 Arguments to the algebraic solver The arguments to the algebraic solvers are as follows: algebra_system: function literal referring to a function specifying the system of algebraic equations with signature (vector, vector, real[], int[]):vector. The arguments represent (1) unknowns, (2) parameters, (3) real data, and (4) integer data, and the return value contains the value of the algebraic function, which goes to 0 when we plug in the solution to the algebraic system, y_guess: initial guess for the solution, type vector, theta: parameters only, type vector, x_r: real data only, type real[], and x_i: integer data only, type int[]. For more fine-grained control of the algebraic solver, these parameters can also be provided: rel_tol: relative tolerance for the algebraic solver, type real, data only, function_tol: function tolerance for the algebraic solver, type real, data only, max_num_steps: maximum number of steps to take in the algebraic solver, type int, data only. 9.1.2.2 Return value The return value for the algebraic solver is an object of type vector, with values which, when plugged in as y make the algebraic function go to 0. 9.1.2.3 Sizes and parallel arrays Certain sizes have to be consistent. The initial guess, return value of the solver, and return value of the algebraic function must all be the same size. The parameters, real data, and integer data will be passed from the solver directly to the system function. 9.1.2.4 Algorithmic details Stan offers two algebraic solvers: algebra_solver and algebra_solver_newton. algebra_solver is baed on the Powell hybrid method (Powell 1970), which in turn uses first-order derivatives. The Stan code builds on the implementation of the hybrid solver in the unsupported module for nonlinear optimization problems of the Eigen library (Guennebaud, Jacob, and others 2010). This solver is in turn based on the algorithm developed for the package MINPACK-1 (Jorge J. More 1980). algebra_solver_newton, uses Newton’s method, also a first-order derivative based numerical solver. The Stan code builds on the implementation in KINSOL from the SUNDIALS suite (Hindmarsh et al. 2005). For many problems, we find that algebra_solver_newton is faster than Powell’s method. If however Newton’s method performs poorly, either failing to or requiring an excessively long time to converge, the user should be prepared to switch to algebra_solver. For both solvers, the Jacobian of the solution with respect to auxiliary parameters is computed using the implicit function theorem. Intermediate Jacobians (of the algebraic function’s output with respect to the unknowns y and with respect to the auxiliary parameters theta) are computed using Stan’s automatic differentiation.

Solving an initial value ODE means given a set of differential equations \\(y&#39;(t, \\theta) = f(t, y, \\theta)\\) and initial conditions \\(y(t_0, \\theta)\\), solving for \\(y\\) at a sequence of times \\(t_0 &lt; t_1 \\leq t_2, \\cdots \\leq t_n\\). \\(f(t, y, \\theta)\\) is referred to here as the ODE system function. \\(f(t, y, \\theta)\\) will be defined as a function with a certain signature and provided along with the initial conditions and output times to one of the ODE solver functions. To make it easier to write ODEs, the solve functions take extra arguments that are passed along unmodified to the user-supplied system function.

The ODE system function should return the derivative of the state with respect to time at the time and state provided.

["functions-1d-integrator.html", "9.3 1D integrator", " 9.3 1D integrator Stan provides a built-in mechanism to perform 1D integration of a function via quadrature methods. It operates similarly to the algebraic solver and the ordinary differential equations solver in that it allows as an argument a function. Like both of those utilities, some of the arguments are limited to data only expressions. These expressions must not contain variables other than those declared in the data or transformed data blocks. 9.3.1 Specifying an integrand as a function Performing a 1D integration requires the integrand to be specified somehow. This is done by defining a function in the Stan functions block with the special signature: real integrand(real x, real xc, real[] theta, real[] x_r, int[] x_i) The function should return the value of the integrand evaluated at the point x. The argument of this function are: x, the independent variable being integrated over xc, a high precision version of the distance from x to the nearest endpoint in a definite integral (for more into see section Precision Loss). theta, parameter values used to evaluate the integral x_r, data values used to evaluate the integral x_i, integer data used to evaluate the integral Like algebraic solver and the differential equations solver, the 1D integrator separates parameter values, theta, from data values, x_r. 9.3.2 Call to the 1D integrator real integrate_1d (function integrand, real a, real b, real[] theta, real[] x_r, int[] x_i) Integrates the integrand from a to b. real integrate_1d (function integrand, real a, real b, real[] theta, real[] x_r, int[] x_i, real relative_tolerance) Integrates the integrand from a to b with the given relative tolerance. 9.3.2.1 Arguments to the 1D integrator The arguments to the 1D integrator are as follows: integrand: function literal referring to a function specifying the integrand with signature (real, real, real[], real[], int[]):real The arguments represent where integrand is evaluated, distance from evaluation point to integration limit for definite integrals, parameters, real data integer data, and the return value is the integrand evaluated at the given point, a: left limit of integration, may be negative infinity, type real, b: right limit of integration, may be positive infinity, type real, theta: parameters only, type real[], x_r: real data only, type real[], x_i: integer data only, type int[]. A relative_tolerance argument can optionally be provided for more control over the algorithm: relative_tolerance: relative tolerance for the 1d integrator, type real, data only. 9.3.2.2 Return value The return value for the 1D integrator is a real, the value of the integral. 9.3.2.3 Zero-crossing integrals For numeric stability, integrals on the (possibly infinite) interval \\((a, b)\\) that cross zero are split into two integrals, one from \\((a, 0)\\) and one from \\((0, b)\\). Each integral is separately integrated to the given relative_tolerance. 9.3.2.4 Precision loss near limits of integration in definite integrals When integrating certain definite integrals, there can be significant precision loss in evaluating the integrand near the endpoints. This has to do with the breakdown in precision of double precision floating point values when adding or subtracting a small number from a number much larger than it in magnitude (for instance, 1.0 - x). xc (as passed to the integrand) is a high-precision version of the distance between x and the definite integral endpoints and can be used to address this issue. More information (and an example where this is useful) is given in the User’s Guide. For zero crossing integrals, xc will be a high precision version of the distance to the endpoints of the two smaller integrals. For any integral with an endpoint at negative infinity or positive infinity, xc is set to NaN. 9.3.2.5 Algorithmic details Internally the 1D integrator uses the double-exponential methods in the Boost 1D quadrature library. Boost in turn makes use of quadrature methods developed in (Takahasi and Mori 1974), (Mori 1978), (Bailey, Jeyabalan, and Li 2005), and (Tanaka et al. 2009). The gradients of the integral are computed in accordance with the Leibniz integral rule. Gradients of the integrand are computed internally with Stan’s automatic differentiation. References "],
["functions-reduce.html", "9.4 Reduce-sum function", " 9.4 Reduce-sum function Stan provides a higher-order reduce function for summation. A function which returns a scalar g: U -&gt; real is mapped to every element of a list of type U[], { x1, x2, ... } and all the results are accumulated, g(x1) + g(x2) + ... For efficiency reasons the reduce function doesn’t work with the element-wise evaluated function g itself, but instead works through evaluating partial sums, f: U[] -&gt; real, where: f({ x1 }) = g(x1) f({ x1, x2 }) = g(x1) + g(x2) f({ x1, x2, ... }) = g(x1) + g(x2) + ... Mathematically the summation reduction is associative and forming arbitrary partial sums in an aribitrary order will not change the result. However, floating point numerics on computers only have a limited precision such that associativity does not hold exactly. This implies that the order of summation determines the exact numerical result. For this reason, the higher-order reduce function is available in two variants: reduce_sum: Automatically choose partial sums partitioning based on a dynamic scheduling algorithm. reduce_sum_static: Compute the same sum as reduce_sum, but partition the input in the same way for given data set (in reduce_sum this partitioning might change depending on computer load). This should result in stable numerical evaluations. 9.4.1 Specifying the reduce-sum function The higher-order reduce function takes a partial sum function f, an array argument x (with one array element for each term in the sum), a recommended grainsize, and a set of shared arguments. This representation allows parallelization of the resultant sum. real reduce_sum(F f, T[] x, int grainsize, T1 s1, T2 s2, ...) real reduce_sum_static(F f, T[] x, int grainsize, T1 s1, T2 s2, ...)

Refer to the partial sum function. x: array of T, one for each term of the reduction, T can be any type, grainsize: For reduce_sum, grainsize is the recommended size of the partial sum (grainsize = 1 means pick totally automatically). For reduce_sum_static, grainsize determines the maximum size of the partial sums, type int, s1: first (optional) shared argument, type T1, where T1 can be any type s2: second (optional) shared argument, type T2, where T2 can be any type, ...: remainder of shared arguments, each of which can be any type. 9.4.2 The partial sum function The partial sum function must have the following signature where the type T, and the types of all the shared arguments (T1, T2, …) match those of the original reduce_sum (reduce_sum_static) call. (T[] x_subset, int start, int end, T1 s1, T2 s2, ...):real The partial sum function returns the sum of the start to end terms (inclusive) of the overall calculations. The arguments to the partial sum function are: x_subset, the subset of x a given partial sum is responsible for computing, type T[], where T matches the type of x in reduce_sum (reduce_sum_static) start, the index of the first term of the partial sum, type int end, the index of the last term of the partial sum (inclusive), type int s1, first shared argument, type T1, matching type of s1 in reduce_sum (reduce_sum_static) s2, second shared argument, type T2, matching type of s2 in reduce_sum (reduce_sum_static) ..., remainder of shared arguments, with types matching those in reduce_sum (reduce_sum_static) "],

["vectorization.html", "11.8 Vectorization", " 11.8 Vectorization Stan’s univariate log probability functions, including the log density functions, log mass functions, log CDFs, and log CCDFs, all support vectorized function application, with results defined to be the sum of the elementwise application of the function. Some of the PRNG functions support vectorization, see section vectorized PRNG functions for more details. In all cases, matrix operations are at least as fast and usually faster than loops and vectorized log probability functions are faster than their equivalent form defined with loops. This isn’t because loops are slow in Stan, but because more efficient automatic differentiation can be used. The efficiency comes from the fact that a vectorized log probability function only introduces one new node into the expression graph, thus reducing the number of virtual function calls required to compute gradients in C++, as well as from allowing caching of repeated computations. Stan also overloads the multivariate normal distribution, including the Cholesky-factor form, allowing arrays of row vectors or vectors for the variate and location parameter. This is a huge savings in speed because the work required to solve the linear system for the covariance matrix is only done once. Stan also overloads some scalar functions, such as log and exp, to apply to vectors (arrays) and return vectors (arrays). These vectorizations are defined elementwise and unlike the probability functions, provide only minimal efficiency speedups over repeated application and assignment in a loop. 11.8.1 Vectorized function signatures 11.8.1.1 Vectorized scalar arguments The normal probability function is specified with the signature normal_lpdf(reals | reals, reals); The pseudotype reals is used to indicate that an argument position may be vectorized. Argument positions declared as reals may be filled with a real, a one-dimensional array, a vector, or a row-vector. If there is more than one array or vector argument, their types can be anything but their size must match. For instance, it is legal to use normal_lpdf(row_vector | vector, real) as long as the vector and row vector have the same size. 11.8.1.2 Vectorized vector and row vector arguments The multivariate normal distribution accepting vector or array of vector arguments is written as multi_normal_lpdf(vectors | vectors, matrix); These arguments may be row vectors, column vectors, or arrays of row vectors or column vectors. 11.8.1.3 Vectorized integer arguments The pseudotype ints is used for vectorized integer arguments. Where it appears either an integer or array of integers may be used. 11.8.2 Evaluating vectorized log probability functions The result of a vectorized log probability function is equivalent to the sum of the evaluations on each element. Any non-vector argument, namely real or int, is repeated. For instance, if y is a vector of size N, mu is a vector of size N, and sigma is a scalar, then ll = normal_lpdf(y | mu, sigma); is just a more efficient way to write ll = 0; for (n in 1:N) ll = ll + normal_lpdf(y[n] | mu[n], sigma); With the same arguments, the vectorized sampling statement y ~ normal(mu, sigma); has the same effect on the total log probability as for (n in 1:N) y[n] ~ normal(mu[n], sigma); 11.8.3 Evaluating vectorized PRNG functions Some PRNG functions accept sequences as well as scalars as arguments. Such functions are indicated by argument pseudotypes reals or ints. In cases of sequence arguments, the output will also be a sequence. For example, the following is allowed in the transformed data and generated quantities blocks. vector[3] mu = ...; real x[3] = normal_rng(mu, 3); 11.8.3.1 Argument types In the case of PRNG functions, arguments marked ints may be integers or integer arrays, whereas arguments marked reals may be integers or reals, integer or real arrays, vectors, or row vectors. pseudotype allowable PRNG arguments ints int, int[] reals int, int[], real, real[], vector, row_vector 11.8.3.2 Dimension matching In general, if there are multiple non-scalar arguments, they must all have the same dimensions, but need not have the same type. For example, the normal_rng function may be called with one vector argument and one real array argument as long as they have the same number of elements. vector[3] mu = ...; real sigma[3] = ...; real x[3] = normal_rng(mu, sigma); 11.8.3.3 Return type The result of a vectorized PRNG function depends on the size of the arguments and the distribution’s support. If all arguments are scalars, then the return type is a scalar. For a continuous distribution, if there are any non-scalar arguments, the return type is a real array (real[]) matching the size of any of the non-scalar arguments, as all non-scalar arguments must have matching size. Discrete distributions return ints and continuous distributions return reals, each of appropriate size. The symbol R denotes such a return type. "],
