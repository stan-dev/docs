# Removed Features {#removed-features}

This chapter lists functionalities that were once present in the language
but have since been removed, along with how to replace them.


## `lp__` variable

*Removed*: The variable `lp__` is no longer available for direct access or
manipulation.

*Replacement*: General manipulation of the value of the `lp__` variable is not
allowed, but

```
lp__ <- lp__ + e;
```

can be replaced with

```
target += e;
```

The value of `lp__` is available through the no-argument function
`target()`.
