# Ordinary Differential Equations  {#ode-solver.chapter}

Stan provides a built-in mechanism for specifying and solving systems
of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Three different solvers,
tuned for solving non-stiff systems and for stiff systems are available.

* `rk45`: a fourth and fifth order Runge-Kutta method for
  non-stiff systems [@DormandPrince:1980; @AhnertMulansky:2011], and

* `adams`: a variable-step, variable-order,
  Adams-Moulton formula implementation for non-stiff systems
  [@CohenHindmarsh:1996; @SerbanHindmarsh:2005]

* `bdf`: a variable-step, variable-order,
  backward-differentiation formula implementation for stiff systems
  [@CohenHindmarsh:1996; @SerbanHindmarsh:2005]

For a discussion of stiff ODE systems, see the [stiff ODE
section](#stiff-ode.section). The function signatures for Stan's ODE
solvers can be found in the reference manual section on ODE solvers.

## Notation

An ODE is defined by a set of differential equations,
$y(t, \theta)' = f(t, y, \theta)$, and initial conditions,
$y(t_0, \theta) = y_0$. The function $f(t, y, \theta)$ is called the
system function. The $\theta$ dependence is included in the notation for
$y(t, \theta)$ and $f(t, y, \theta)$ as a reminder that the solution is a function of any parameters used
in the computation.

## Example: Simple Harmonic Oscillator

As an example of a system of ODEs, consider a harmonic oscillator. In a harmonic
oscillator a particle disturbed from equilibrium is pulled back towards its
equilibrium position by a force proportional to its displacement from equilibrium.
The system here additionally has a friction force proportional to particle speed
which points in the opposite direction of the particle velocity.
The system state will be a pair $y = (y_1, y_2)$ representing position and
speed. The change in the system with respect to time is given by the following differential equations.^[This example is drawn from the documentation for the Boost Numeric Odeint library [@AhnertMulansky:2011], which Stan uses to implement the `rk45` solver.]

$$
\frac{d}{dt} y_1 = y_2 \\
\frac{d}{dt} y_2 = -y_1 - \theta y_2
$$

The state equations implicitly defines the state at future times
as a function of an initial state and the system parameters.

## Coding the ODE System Function

The first step in coding an ODE system in Stan is defining the ODE system
function. The system functions require a specific signature so that the solvers
know how to use them properly.

The first argument to the system function is time, passed as a `real`;
the second argument to the system function is the system state,
passed as a `vector`, and the return value from the system function are the
current time derivatives of the state defined as a `vector`. Additional arguments
can be included in the system function to pass other information
into the solve (these will be passed through the function that starts the ODE
integration). These argument can be parameters (in this case, the friction
coefficient), data, or any quantities that are needed to define the
differential equation.

The simple harmonic oscillator can be coded using the following function
in Stan (see the [user-defined functions chapter](#functions-programming.chapter) for
more information on coding user-defined functions).

```
vector sho(real t,        // time
           vector y,      // state
           real theta) {  // friction parameter
  vector[2] dydt;
  dydt[1] = y[2];
  dydt[2] = -y[1] - theta * y[2];
  return dydt;
}
```

The function takes in a time `t` (a `real`), the system state
`y` (a `vector`), and the parameter `theta` (a `real`). The function returns a
`vector` of time derivatives of the system state at time `t`, state `y`, and
parameter `theta`. The simple harmonic oscillator coded here does not have
time-sensitive equations; that is, `t` does not show up in the definition of
`dydt`, however it is still required.

### Strict Signature {-}

The types in the ODE system function are strict. The first argument is the time
passed as a `real`, the second argument is the state passed as a `vector`,
and the return type is a `vector`. A model that does not have this signature will
fail to compile. The third argument onwards can be any type, granted all
the argument types match the types of the respective arguments in the solver
call.

All of these are possible ODE signatures:

```
vector myode1(real t, vector y, real a0);
vector myode2(real t, vector y, int[] a0, vector a1);
vector myode3(real t, vector y, matrix a0, real[] a1, row_vector a2);
```

but these are not allowed:

```
vector myode1(real t, real[] y, real a0); // Second argument is not a vector
real[] myode2(real t, vector y, real a0); // Return type is not a vector
vector myode3(vector y, real a0); // First argument is not a real and second is not a vector
```

## Measurement Error Models

Noisy observations of the ODE state can be used to estimate the parameters
and/or the initial state of the system.

### Simulating Noisy Measurements {-}

As an example, suppose the simple harmonic oscillator has a parameter
value of $\theta = 0.15$ and an initial state $y(t = 0, \theta = 0.15) = (1, 0)$.
Assume the system is measured at 10 time points, $t = 1, 2, \cdots, 10$,
where each measurement of $y(t, \theta)$ has independent
$\textsf{normal}(0, 0.1)$ error in both dimensions ($y_1(t, \theta)$
and $y_2(t, \theta)$).

The following model can be used to generate data like this:

```
functions {
  vector sho(real t,
             vector y,
             real theta) {
    vector[2] dydt;
    dydt[1] = y[2];
    dydt[2] = -y[1] - theta * y[2];
    return dydt;
  }
}
data {
  int<lower=1> T;
  vector[2] y0;
  real t0;
  real ts[T];
  real theta;
}
model {
}
generated quantities {
  vector[2] y_sim[T] = ode_rk45(sho, y0, t0, ts, theta);
  // add measurement error
  for (t in 1:T) {
    y_sim[t, 1] += normal_rng(0, 0.1);
    y_sim[t, 2] += normal_rng(0, 0.1);
  }
}
```

The system parameters `theta` and initial state `y0` are read in as data
along with the initial time `t0` and observation times `ts`. The ODE is solved
for the specified times, and then random measurement errors are added to
produce simulated observations `y_sim`. Because the system is not stiff, the
`ode_rk45` solver is used.

This program illustrates the way in which the ODE solver is called in
a Stan program,

```
vector[2] y_sim[T] = ode_rk45(sho, y0, t0, ts, theta);
```

this returns the solution of the ODE initial value problem defined
by system function `sho`, initial state `y0`, initial time `t0`, and
parameter `theta` at the times `ts`. The call explicitly
specifies the non-stiff RK45 solver.

The parameter `theta` is passed unmodified
to the ODE system function. If there were additional arguments that must be
passed, they could be appended to the end of the ode call here. For instance, if
the system function took two parameters, $\theta$ and $\beta$, the system
function definition would look like:

```
vector sho(real t, vector y, real theta, real beta) { ... }
```

and the appropriate ODE solver call would be:

```
ode_rk45(sho, y0, t0, ts, theta, beta);
```

Any number of additional arguments can be added. They can be any Stan type (as
long as the types match between the ODE system function and the solver call).

Because all none of the input arguments are a function of parameters, the ODE
solver is called in the generated quantities block. The random measurement noise
is added to each of the `T` outputs with `normal_rng`.

```{r  include = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Typical realization of harmonic oscillator trajectory."}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/sho-ode-trajectory.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```


### Estimating System Parameters and Initial State {-}

These ten noisy observations of the state can be used to estimate the friction
parameter, $\theta$, the initial conditions, $y(t_0, \theta)$, and the scale of
the noise in the problem. The full Stan model is:

\newpage
```
functions {
  vector sho(real t,
             vector y,
             real theta) {
    vector[2] dydt;
    dydt[1] = y[2];
    dydt[2] = -y[1] - theta * y[2];
    return dydt;
  }
}
data {
  int<lower=1> T;
  vector[2] y[T];
  real t0;
  real ts[T];
}
parameters {
  vector[2] y0;
  vector<lower=0>[2] sigma;
  real theta;
}
model {
  vector[2] mu[T] = ode_rk45(sho, y0, t0, ts, theta);
  sigma ~ normal(0, 2.5);
  theta ~ std_normal();
  y0 ~ std_normal();
  for (t in 1:T)
    y[t] ~ normal(mu[t], sigma);
}
```

Because the solves are now a function of model parameters, the `ode_rk45`
call is now made in the model block. There are half-normal priors on the
measurement error scales `sigma`, and standard normal priors on `theta` and the
initial state vector `y0`. The solutions to the ODE are assigned to `mu`, which
is used as the location for the normal observation model.

As with other regression models, it's easy to change the noise
model to something with heavier tails (e.g., Student-t distributed),
correlation in the state variables (e.g., with a multivariate
normal distribution), or both heavy tails and correlation in the state
variables (e.g., with a multivariate Student-t distribution).

## Stiff ODEs {#stiff-ode.section}

Stiffness is a numerical phenomena that causes some differential equation
solvers difficulty, notably the Runge-Kutta RK45 solver used in the examples
earlier. The phenomena is common in chemical reaction systems, which are often
characterized by having multiple vastly different time-scales. The stiffness of
a system can also vary between different parts of parameter space, and so a
typically non-stiff system may exhibit stiffness occasionally. These sorts of
difficulties can occur more frequently with loose priors or during warmup.

Stan provides a specialized solver for stiff ODEs
[@CohenHindmarsh:1996; @SerbanHindmarsh:2005].  An ODE system is
specified exactly the same way with a function of exactly the same
signature.  The only difference is in the call to the solver the
`rk45` suffix is replaced with `bdf`, as in

```
ode_bdf(sho, y0, t0, ts, theta);
```

Using the stiff (`bdf`) solver on a system that is not stiff
may be much slower than using the non-stiff (`rk45`) solver because
each step of the stiff solver takes more time to compute. On the other hand,
attempting to use the non-stiff solver for a stiff system will cause
the timestep to become very small, leading the non-stiff solver taking more
time overall even if each step is easier to compute than for the stiff solver.

If it is not known for sure that an ODE system is stiff, run the model with
both the `rk45` and `bdf` solvers and see which is faster. If the `rk45`
solver is faster, then the problem is probably non-stiff, and then it makes
sense to try the `adams` solver as well. The `adams` solver uses higher order
methods which can take larger timesteps than the `rk45` solver, though similar
to the `bdf` solver each of these steps is more expensive to compute.

## Control Parameters for ODE Solving

For additional control of the solves, both the stiff and non-stiff solvers
have function signatures that makes it possible to specify the
`relative_tolerance`, `absolute_tolerance`, and `max_num_steps` parameters.
These are the same as the regular function names but with `_tol` appended to
the end. All three control arguments must be supplied with this signature (there
are no defaults).

```
vector[2] y_sim[T] = ode_bdf_tol(sho, y0, t0, ts,
                                 relative_tolerance,
                                 absolute_tolerance,
                                 max_num_steps,
                                 theta);
```

`relative_tolerance` and `absolute_tolerance` control the stepsize by specifying
a target local error that the solver tries to match, and
`max_num_steps` specifies the maximum number of steps the solver will
take between output time points before throwing an error.

The control parameters must be data variables -- they cannot be
parameters or expressions that depend on parameters, including local
variables in any block other than transformed data and generated
quantities. User-defined function arguments may be qualified as only
allowing data arguments using the `data` qualifier.

For the RK45 solver, the default values for relative and absolute tolerance are
both $10^{-6}$ and the maximum number of steps between outputs is
one million. For the BDF and Adams solvers, the relative and absolute
tolerances are $10^{-10}$ and the maximum number of steps between outputs is
one hundred million.

### Discontinuous ODE System Function {-}

If there are discontinuities in the ODE system function, it is best
to integrate the ODE between the discontinuities, stopping the solver at each
one, and restarting it on the other side.

Nonetheless, the ODE solvers will attempt to integrate over discontinuities
they encounters in the state function. The accuracy of the solution near the
discontinuity may be problematic (requiring many small steps). An example of
such a discontinuity is a lag in a pharmacokinetic model, where a
concentration is zero for times $0 < t < t'$ and then positive for $t \geq t'$.
In this example example, we would use code in the system such as

```
if (t < t_lag)
  return 0;
else
  ... return non-zero value...;
```

In general it is better to integrate up to `t_lag` in one solve and
then integrate from `t_lag` onwards in another. Mathematically, the
discontinuity can make the problem ill-defined and the numerical integrator
may behave erratically around it.

If the location of the discontinuity cannot be controlled precisely, or there is
some other rapidly change in ODE behavior, it can be useful to tell the ODE
solver to produce output in the neighborhood. This can help the ODE solver avoid
indiscriminately stepping over an important feature of the solution.

### Tolerance {-}

The relative and absolute tolerance control the accuracy of the
solutions generated by the ODE solvers. Relative tolerances are
relative to the solution value, whereas absolute tolerances is the
maximum absolute error allowed in a solution. Absolute tolerance is more
meaningful for ODE solutions that approach zero.

Smaller tolerances produce more accurate solutions, though they require more
computation time. The tolerances should be small enough so that setting them
lower does not change the statistical properties of posterior samples generated
by the Stan program but large enough to avoid unnecessary computation.

### Maximum Number of Steps {-}

The maximum number of steps can be used to stop a runaway simulation.
This can arise in when MCMC moves to a part of parameter space very far from
where a differential equation would typically be solved. In particular this
can happen during warmup.  With the non-stiff solver, this may happen when
the sampler moves to stiff regions of parameter space, which will requires small
step sizes.

## Solving a System of Linear ODEs using a Matrix Exponential

Linear systems of ODEs can be solved using a matrix exponential. This can be
considerably faster than using one of the ODE solvers.

The solution to $\frac{d}{dt} y = ay$ is $y = y_0e^{at}$, where the constant
$y_0$ is determined by boundary conditions. We can extend this solution
to the vector case:
$$
\frac{d}{dt}y = A \, y
$$
<a name="id:ode.linODEs"></a>
where $y$ is now a vector of length $n$ and $A$ is an $n$ by $n$ matrix. The
solution is then given by:
$$
y = e^{tA} \, y_0
$$
<a name="id:ode.linOEs.sln"></a>
where the matrix exponential is formally defined by the convergent power series:
$$
e^{tA} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \dfrac{tA^n}{n!} = I + tA + \frac{t^2A^2}{2!} + \dotsb
$$
<a name="id:ode.matrix_exp.def"></a>

We can apply this technique to the simple harmonic oscillator example, by
setting
$$
y = \begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\ y_2 \end{bmatrix} \qquad
A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & -\theta \end{bmatrix}
$$
<a name="id:ode.sho_matrix"></a>

The Stan model to simulate noisy observations using a matrix exponential function
is given below.

In general, computing a matrix exponential will be more efficient than using a numerical
solver. We can however only apply this technique to systems of linear ODEs.

```
data {
  int<lower=1> T;
  vector[2] y0;
  real ts[T];
  real theta[1];
}
model {
}
generated quantities {
  vector[2] y_sim[T];
  matrix[2, 2] A = [[ 0,  1],
                    [-1, -theta[1]]]
  for (t in 1:T)
    y_sim[t] = matrix_exp((t - 1) * A) * y0;
  // add measurement error
  for (t in 1:T) {
    y_sim[t, 1] += normal_rng(0, 0.1);
    y_sim[t, 2] += normal_rng(0, 0.1);
  }
}
```
<a name="id:sho-sim-me.figure"></a>

This Stan program simulates noisy measurements from a simple harmonic
oscillator.  The system of linear differential equations is coded as a
matrix. The system parameters `theta` and initial state `y0` are read
in as data along observation times `ts`.  The generated quantities
block is used to solve the ODE for the specified times and then add
random measurement error, producing observations `y_sim`. Because the
ODEs are linear, we can use the `matrix_exp` function to solve the
system.
