# Deprecated Features

This appendix lists currently deprecated functionality along with how
to replace it.

Starting with Stan 2.29, minor (syntax-level) deprecations can be removed 3
versions after release; e.g., syntax deprecated in Stan 2.20 will be removed in
Stan 2.23 and placed in [Removed Features]. The Stan compiler can
[automatically update](https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/stanc-pretty-printing.html)
many of these on the behalf of the user.

Any feature which changes semantic meaning (such as the upgraded ODE solver
interface) will not be removed until a major version change (e.g., Stan 3.0).


## Assignment with `<-`

*Deprecated*: The deprecated syntax uses the operator `<-` for
  assignment, e.g.,

```stan
a <- b;
```

*Replacement*: The new syntax uses the operator `=` for assignment,
  e.g.,

```stan
a = b;
```

*Scheduled Removal*: Stan 2.32

## `increment_log_prob` statement


*Deprecated*: The deprecated syntax for incrementing the log density
  accumulator by `u` is

```stan
increment_log_prob(u);
```

If `u` is an expression of real type, the underlying log density
accumulator is incremented by `u`; if `u` is a container, the
underlying log density is incremented with each element.

*Replacement*: Replace the above statement with

```stan
target += u;
```

*Scheduled Removal*: Stan 2.32

## `get_lp()` function


*Deprecated*: The built-in no-argument function `get_lp()` is deprecated.

*Replacement*: Use the no-argument function `target()` instead.


*Scheduled Removal*: Stan 2.32

## `_log` density and mass functions


*Deprecated*: The probability function for the distribution `foo` will
be applied to an outcome variable `y` and sequence of zero or more
parameters `...` to produce the expression `foo_log(y, ...)`.

*Replacement*: If `y` can be a real value (including vectors
or matrices), replace

```stan
foo_log(y, ...)
```

with the log probability density function notation

```stan
foo_lpdf(y | ...).
```

If `y` must be an integer (including arrays), instead replace

```stan
foo_log(y, ...
```

with the log probability mass function

```stan
foo_lpmf(y | ...).
```

*Scheduled Removal*: Stan 2.32

## `cdf_log` and `ccdf_log` cumulative distribution functions

*Deprecated*: The log cumulative distribution and complementary
cumulative distribution functions for a distribution `foo` are
currently written as `foo_cdf_log` and `foo_ccdf_log`.

*Replacement*: Replace `foo_cdf_log(y, ...)` with `foo_lcdf(y | ...)`.
Replace `foo_ccdf_log(y, ...)` with `foo_lccdf(y | ...)`.


## User-defined function with `_log` suffix

*Deprecated*: A user-defined function ending in `_log` can
  be used in sampling statements, with

```stan
y ~ foo(...);
```

having the same effect as

```stan
target += foo_log(y, ...);
```

*Replacement*: Replace the `_log` suffix with `_lpdf` for density
functions or `_lpmf` for mass functions in the user-defined function.


*Scheduled Removal*: Stan 2.32

Note: Following Stan 2.32, users can stil define a function ending in `_log`,
it will just no longer have a special meaning or support the `~` syntax.

## `lkj_cov` distribution

*Deprecated*:The distribution `lkj_cov` is deprecated.

*Replacement*: Replace `lkj_cov_log(...)` with an `lkj_corr`
  distribution on the correlation matrix and independent lognormal
  distributions on the scales.  That is, replace

```stan
cov_matrix[K] Sigma;
// ...
Sigma ~ lkj_cov(mu, tau, eta);
```

with

```stan
corr_matrix[K] Omega;
vector<lower=0>[K] sigma;
// ...
Omega ~ lkj_corr(eta);
sigma ~ lognormal(mu, tau);
// ...
cov_matrix[K] Sigma;
Sigma <- quad_form_diag(Omega, sigma);
```

The variable `Sigma` may be defined as a local variable in the model
block or as a transformed parameter.  An even more efficient transform
would use Cholesky factors rather than full correlation matrix types.


*Scheduled Removal*: Stan 3.0 or later.

## `if_else` function

*Deprecated*:The function `if_else` is deprecated.  This function
takes three arguments `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `a` is an `int` value
and `b` and `c` are scalars. It returns `b` if `a` is non-zero and `c`
otherwise.

*Replacement*: Use the conditional operator which allows more
flexibility in the types of `b` and `c` and is much more efficient in
that it only evaluates whichever of `b` or `c` is returned.

```stan
x = if_else(a, b, c);
```

with

```stan
x = a ? b : c;
```

*Scheduled Removal*: Stan 2.32

##  Character `#` as comment prefix

*Deprecated*: The use of `#` for line-based comments is
  deprecated.  From the first occurrence of `#` onward, the rest
  of the line is ignored.  This happens after includes are resolved
  starting with `#include`.

*Replacement*: Use a pair of forward slashes, `//`, for line
  comments.

*Scheduled Removal*: Stan 2.32

## Brackets array syntax

Before Stan 2.26, arrays were declared by writing syntax after the
variable.  As of version 2.26, the old syntax has been deprecated and
replaced with a keyword-based syntax.

*Deprecated*: The use of array declarations like
```stan
int n[5];
real a[3, 4];
real<lower=0> z[5, 4, 2];
vector[7] mu[3];
matrix[7, 2] mu[15, 12];
cholesky_factor_cov[5, 6] mu[2, 3, 4];
```

*Replacement*: The use of the `array` keyword, which replaces the
 above examples with
```stan
array[5] int n;
array[3, 4] real a;
array[5, 4, 2] real<lower=0> z;
array[3] vector[7] mu;
array[15, 12] matrix[7, 2] mu;
array[2, 3, 4] cholesky_factor_cov[5, 6] mu;
```

*Scheduled Removal*: Stan 2.32


## New Keywords

*Deprecated*: The following identifiers will become
[reserved](#reserved-names)
in the language in the specified version.

*Replacement*: Rename any variables or functions with these names.

| Identifier | Version |
|------------|---------|
| array      | 2.32    |
| lower      | 2.32    |
| upper      | 2.32    |
| offset     | 2.32    |
| multiplier | 2.32    |


## Deprecated Functions

Several built-in Stan functions have been deprecated. Consult the
[functions reference](https://mc-stan.org/docs/functions-reference/deprecated-functions.html)
