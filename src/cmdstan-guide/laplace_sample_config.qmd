# Laplace sampling

The `laplace` method produces a sample from a normal approximation
centered at the [mode](optimize_config.qmd) of a distribution in the unconstrained space.
If the mode is a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate,
the samples provide an estimate of the mean and standard deviation
of the posterior distribution.
If the mode is a maximum likelihood estimate (MLE),
the sample provides an estimate of the standard error of the likelihood.
In general,  the posterior mode in the unconstrained space doesn't correspond
to the mean (nor mode) in the constrained space, and thus the sample is needed
to infer the mean as well as the standard deviation.
(See [this case study](https://avehtari.github.io/casestudies/Jacobian/jacobian.html)
for a visual illustration.)

This is computationally inexpensive compared to exact Bayesian inference with MCMC.
The goodness of this estimate depends on both the estimate of the mode
and how much the true posterior in the unconstrained space resembles a Gaussian.


## Configuration

This method takes 2 arguments:

- `jacobian` - Whether or not the
[Jacobian adjustment](https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/reparameterization.html)
should be included in the gradient. The default value is 1 (include adjustment).
(Note: in optimization, the default value is `0`, for historical reasons.)

- `mode` - Input file of parameters values on the constrained scale.
When Stan's `optimize` method is used to estimate the modal values,
the value of boolean argument `jacobian` should be 0 if `optimize` was
run with default settings, i.e., the input is the MLE estimate;
if `optimize` was run with argument `jacobian=1`, then the `laplace`
method default setting, `jacobian=1`, should be used.



## CSV output

The output file consists of the following pieces of information:

- The full set of configuration options available for the `laplace` method is
  reported at the beginning of the output file as CSV comments.

- Output columns `log_p__` and `log_q__`, the unnormalized log density and the
unnormalized density of the Laplace approximation, respectively.
These can be used for diagnostics and importance sampling.

- Output columns for all model parameters on the constrained scale.

## Example

To get an approximate estimate of the mode and standard deviation of the
example Bernoulli model given the example dataset:

- find the MAP estimate by running optimization with argument `jacobian=1`

- run the Laplace estimator using the MAP estimate as the `mode` argument.

Because the default output file name from all methods is `output.csv`,
a more informative name is used for the output of optimization.
We run the commands from the CmdStan home directory.
This results in a sample with mean 2.7 and standard deviation 0.12.
In comparison, running the NUTS-HMC sampler results in mean 2.6 and standard deviation 0.12.
