# `stanc`: Translating Stan to C++ {#stanc}

CmdStan translates Stan programs to C++ using the Stan compiler
program which is included in the CmdStan release `bin` directory as
program `stanc`. One can view the complete stanc documentation in the
[Stan User's Guide](../stan-users-guide/using-stanc.Rmd).

As of release 2.22, the CmdStan Stan to C++ compiler is written in
OCaml. This compiler is called "stanc3" and has has its own
repository https://github.com/stan-dev/stanc3, from which pre-built
binaries for Linux, Mac, and Windows can be downloaded.


## Instantiating the `stanc` binary

Before the Stan compiler can be used, the binary stanc must be
created. This can be done using the makefile as follows. For Mac and
Linux:
```
make bin/stanc
```
For Windows:
```
make bin/stanc.exe
```

This is also done as part of the `make build` command.

## The Stan compiler program

The Stan compiler program `stanc` converts Stan programs to C++ concepts.
If the compiler encounters syntax errors in the program,
it will provide an error message indicating the location
in the input where the failure occurred and reason for the failure.
The following example illustrates a fully qualified call to stanc to
generate the C++ translation of the example model `bernoulli.stan`.
For Linux and Mac:
```
> cd <cmdstan-home>
> bin/stanc --o=bernoulli.hpp examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.stan
```
For Windows:
```
> cd <cmdstan-home>
> bin/stanc.exe --o=bernoulli.hpp examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.stan
```

The base name of the Stan program file determines the name of the C++ model class.
Because this name is the name of a C++ class, it must
start with an alphabetic character (`a--z` or `A--Z`) and
contain only alphanumeric characters (`a--z`, `A--Z`, and
`0--9`) and underscores (`_`) and should not conflict with
any C++ reserved keyword.

The C++ code implementing the class is written to the file
`bernoulli.hpp` in the current directory. The final argument,
`bernoulli.stan`, is the file from which to read the Stan
program.

In practice, stanc is invoked indirectly, via the GNU Make utility,
which contains rules that compile a Stan program to its corresponding
executable. To build the simple Bernoulli model via `make`, we specify
the name of the target executable file.
On Mac and Linux, this is the name of the Stan program with the `.stan`
omitted. On Windows, replace `.stan` with `.exe`, and make
sure that the path is given with slashes and not backslashes.
For Linux and Mac:
```
> make examples/bernoulli/bernoulli
```
For Windows:
```
> make examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.exe
```

The makefile rules first invoke the stanc compiler to translate the
Stan model to C++ , then compiles and links the C++ code to a binary
executable. The makefile variable `STANCFLAGS` can be used to to
override the default
[arguments](../stan-users-guide/using-stanc.Rmd#stanc-args) to stanc,
e.g.,
```
> make STANCFLAGS="--include-paths=~/foo" examples/bernoulli/bernoulli
```
