## Stan Documentation Issues

If you would like to make a suggestion for fixing a typo or unclear part of the docs, please make a comment on the currently open next docs issue (it will be numbered by current release followed by `++`) and we will fix it in the next release after the current release:

* [Next release Stan documentation](https://github.com/stan-dev/docs/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aopen%20label%3ABug%20%22next%20release%20documentation)

This is easier for us than having to deal with a typo pull request, though we will gladly take those, too.
