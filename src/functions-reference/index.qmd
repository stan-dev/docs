This is the reference for the functions defined in the Stan math
library and available in the Stan programming language.

For more information the Stan language and inference engines and how to use Stan
for Bayesian inference, see

- the [**Stan User's Guide**](https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/index.html).
The Stan user's guide provides example models and programming
techniques for coding statistical models in Stan.
It also serves as an example-driven introduction to Bayesian modeling
and inference:

- the [**Stan Reference Manual**](https://mc-stan.org/docs/reference-manual/index.html).
Stan's modeling language is shared across all of its interfaces.
The Stan Language Reference Manual provides a concise definition
of the language syntax for all elements in the language
together with an overview of the inference algorithms and posterior inference tools.
