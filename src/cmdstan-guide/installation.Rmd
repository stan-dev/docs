# CmdStan Installation

To install CmdStan you need:

- A modern C++11 compiler.  [Supported versions](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Coding-Style-and-Idioms#supported-cpp-versions-and-compilers) are   <br>
  $\tiny\bullet$ Linux: g++ 4.9.3 or clang 6.0   <br>
  $\tiny\bullet$ macOS: the XCode version of clang   <br>
  $\tiny\bullet$ Windows: g++ 8.1 (available with RTools 4.0) is recommended; alternatively, g++ 4.9.3 (available with RTools 3.5).

- The [GNU-Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)
utility program or the Windows equivalent `mingw32-make`.
On macOS, this is part of the XCode command line tools installed via command `xcode-select --install`.
On Windows, `mingw32-make` is installed as part of RTools: https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/.

- The CmdStan C++ source code and libraries.<br>
The most recent CmdStan release is available as a single compressed tarfile
containing all of the CmdStan tools and the Stan and math libraries from GitHub:
https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan/releases/latest
or you can [clone the GitHub repo](#git-clone.section).

The CmdStan release unpacks into a directory called `cmdstan-<version>` where the
version string consists of the major.minor.patch version numbers, e.g. `cmdstan-2.23.0`.
Cloning CmdStan from GitHub creates a directory simply called `cmdstan`.
Throughout this manual, we refer to this top-level CmdStan source directory as **`<cmdstan-home>`**.


## Installing the C++ Toolchain

The C++ toolchain consists of a modern C++ compiler and the GNU-Make utility,
described in greater detail in the following section.

### Linux:  `g++` and `make`


On Linux, the C++ compiler command `g++` and the GNU-Make command is `make`.
These are often installed by default.
To check, run commands:

```
g++ --version
make --version
```

If these are at least at `g++` version 4.9.3 or later and
`make` version 3.81 or later, no additional installations are
necessary. It may still be desirable to update the C++ compiler
`g++`, because later versions are faster.

To install the latest version of these tools (or upgrade an older
version), use the following commands or their equivalent for your
distribution, install via the commands:

```
sudo apt install g++
sudo apt install make
```

If you can't run `sudo`, you will need to ask your sysadmin
or cluster administrator to install these tools for you.

### MacOS:  `clang++` and `make`

To install a C++ development
environment on a Mac, use Apple's Xcode development environment
https://developer.apple.com/xcode/.

From the [Xcode home page](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
`View in Mac App Store`.

- From the App Store, click `Install`, enter an Apple ID, and wait
for Xcode to finish installing.
-  Open the Xcode application, click top-level menu `Preferences`,
click top-row button `Downloads`, click button for
`Components`, click on the `Install` button to the right of
the `Command Line Tools` entry, then wait for it to finish
installing.
- Click the top-level menu item `Xcode`, then click item `Quit
Xcode` to quit.

To test, open the Terminal application and enter:
```
clang++ --version
make --version
```

If you have installed XCode, but don't have `make`, you can install the
XCode command-line tools via command:
```
xcode-select --install
```

_Note_ MacOS installations may include old version of the `g++` compiler which is a version 4.2.1.
CmdStan requires g++ at 4.9.3 or later.  Trying to install later versions of g++ using `homebrew`
or `macports` is no longer recommended; use the XCode toolchain.


### Windows:  `g++` and `mingw32-make`

The Windows toolchain consists of programs `g++`, the C++ compiler,
and `mingw32-make`, the GNU-Make utility.
To check if these are present,
open a command shell [^1]
and type:
```
g++ --version
mingw32-make --version
```

__Rtools C++ Development Environment__

The simplest way to install a full C++ build environment that will
work for CmdStan is to use the Rtools package designed for R
developers on Windows (even if you don't plan to use R).

If you don't have RTools, the latest version is `Rtools40` (released April 2020)
which can be downloaded from:

- https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/

After installation is complete, you need to perform one more step:
you need to add the location of the Rtools compiler and make utilities
to the `PATH` environment variable.  If you have `Rtools40`, these should be:
```
C:\RTools\RTools40\usr\bin
C:\RTools\RTools40\mingw64\bin
```
If you have and earlier version of RTools, e.g., RTools 3.6, use `RTools36` istead of `RTools40` in the above paths.
See [these instructions](https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/)
for details on changing the `PATH`.

__32-bit Builds__

CmdStan defaults to a 64-bit build. On a 32-bit operating system,
include `BIT=32` in CmdStan `make/local` file described in the next section.

## GNU-Make Utility

CmdStan relies on the GNU-make utility to build both the
Stan model executables and the CmdStan tools.

GNU-Make builds executable programs and libraries from source code by reading files
called Makefiles which specify how to derive the target program.
A Makefile consists of a set of recursive rules where each rule
specifies a target, its dependencies, 
and the specific operations required to build the target.
Specifying dependencies for a target provides a way to control
the build process so that targets which depend on other files will
be updated as needed _only_ when there are changes to those other files.
Thus Make provides an efficient way to manage complex software.

The CmdStan Makefile is in the `<cmdstan-home>` directory
and is named `makefile`. This is one of the default
[GNU Makefile names](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Makefile-Names.html),
which allows you to omit the `-f makefile` argument to the Make command.
Because the CmdStan Makefile includes several other Makefiles,
**Make only works properly when invoked from the `<cmdstan-home>` directory**;
attempts to use this Makefile from another directory by specifying the
full path to the file `makefile` won't work.
For example, trying to call Make from another directory by specifying
the full path the the makefile results in the following set of error messages:

```
make -f ~/github/stan-dev/cmdstan/makefile
/Users/mitzi/github/stan-dev/cmdstan/makefile:58: make/stanc: No such file or directory
/Users/mitzi/github/stan-dev/cmdstan/makefile:59: make/program: No such file or directory
/Users/mitzi/github/stan-dev/cmdstan/makefile:60: make/tests: No such file or directory
/Users/mitzi/github/stan-dev/cmdstan/makefile:61: make/command: No such file or directory
make: *** No rule to make target `make/command'.  Stop.
```

Makefile rules can be written as general pattern rules based on file suffixes.
The Stan makefile rules specify how to process Stan program files with
suffix `.stan` into executable files.
For example, to compile the Stan program `my_program.stan` in directory `../my_dir/`,
the make target is `../my_dir/my_program` or ` ../my_dir/my_program.exe` (on Windows).

Make is invoked with a list of target names.
Makefile targets can be preceded by zero or more Makefile variable name=value pairs.
For example to compile `../my_dir/my_program.stan` for an OpenCL (GPU) machine,
the makefile variable `STAN_OPENCL` is set to `TRUE`:
```
> make STAN_OPENCL=TRUE ../my_dir/my_program
```
Makefile variables can also be set by creating a file named `local` in the
CmdStan `make` subdirectory which contains a list of `<VARIABLE>=<VALUE>` pairs,
one per line.  The complete set of Makefile variables can be found in file
`cmdstan/stan/lib/stan_math/make/compiler_flags`.

When invoked without any arguments at all, Make prints a help message:
```
> make
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CmdStan v2.23.0 help

  Build CmdStan utilities:
    > make build

    This target will:
    1. Install the Stan compiler bin/stanc from stanc3 binaries.
    2. Build the print utility bin/print (deprecated; will be removed in v3.0)
    3. Build the stansummary utility bin/stansummary
    4. Build the diagnose utility bin/diagnose
    5. Build all libraries and object files compile and link an executable Stan program

    Note: to build using multiple cores, use the -j option to make, e.g., 
    for 4 cores:
    > make build -j4


  Build a Stan program:

    Given a Stan program at foo/bar.stan, build an executable by typing:
    > make foo/bar

    This target will:
    1. Install the Stan compiler (bin/stanc or bin/stanc2), as needed.
    2. Use the Stan compiler to generate C++ code, foo/bar.hpp.
    3. Compile the C++ code using cc . to generate foo/bar

  Additional make options:
    STANCFLAGS: defaults to "". These are extra options passed to bin/stanc
      when generating C++ code. If you want to allow undefined functions in the
      Stan program, either add this to make/local or the command line:
          STANCFLAGS = --allow_undefined
    USER_HEADER: when STANCFLAGS has --allow_undefined, this is the name of the
      header file that is included. This defaults to "user_header.hpp" in the
      directory of the Stan program.
    STANC2: When set, use bin/stanc2 to generate C++ code.


  Example - bernoulli model: examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.stan

    1. Build the model:
       > make examples/bernoulli/bernoulli
    2. Run the model:
       > examples/bernoulli/bernoulli sample data file=examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.data.R
    3. Look at the samples:
       > bin/stansummary output.csv


  Clean CmdStan:

    Remove the built CmdStan tools:
    > make clean-all

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

## Clone the GitHub CmdStan Repository {#git-clone.section}

This section can be skipped if you want to build CmdStan using the release tarfile,
which contains all source files an libraries needed to build CmdStan.
However, if you wish to use the current (stable) development version of CmdStan,
you must clone the [CmdStan GitHub repo](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan).

The CmdStan repo contains just the `cmdstan` module;
the Stan inference engine algorithms and Stan math library functions
are specified as [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
and stored in the GitHub repositories
[stan](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan) and [math](https://github.com/stan-dev/math),
respectively.
By cloning the CmdStan repository with argument `--recursive`,
Git automatically initializes and updates each submodule in the repository,
including nested submodules if any of the submodules
in the repository have submodules themselves.

The following sequence of commands will check out the current
CmdStan `develop` branch on GitHub and assemble and build the
command line interface and supporting libraries:

```
> git clone https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan.git --recursive
> cd cmdstan
> make build
```

The resulting set of directories should have the same structure as the release:

- directory `cmdstan/stan` contains the sub-module `stan` (https://github.com/stan-dev/stan)
- directory `cmdstan/stan/lib/stan_math` contains the sub-module `math` (https://github.com/stan-dev/math)

## Building CmdStan

Building CmdStan involves preparing a set of executable programs
and compiling the command line interface and supporting libraries.
The CmdStan tools are:

- `stanc`: the Stan compiler (translates Stan language to C++).

- `stansummary`: a basic posterior analysis tool.
The `stansummary` utility processes one or more output files from a run
or set of runs of Stan's HMC sampler.
For all parameters and quantities of interest in the Stan program,
`stansummary` reports a set of statistics including mean, standard deviation,
percentiles, effective number of samples, and $\hat{R}$ values.

- `diagnose`: a basic sampler diagnostic tool which checks for indications
that the HMC sampler was unable to sample from the full posterior.

CmdStan releases include pre-built binaries of the Stan language
compiler \url {https://github.com/stan-dev/stanc3}:
`bin/linux-stanc`, `bin/mac-stanc` and
`bin/windows-stanc`. The CmdStan makefile `build` task
copies the appropriate binary to `bin/stanc`. For CmdStan
installations which have been cloned of downloaded from the CmdStan
GitHub repository, the makefile task will download the appropriate
OS-specific binary from the stanc3 repository's nightly release.

Steps to build CmdStan:

- Download the latest release from https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan/releases/latest
or [clone the GitHub repo](#git-clone.section).

- Open a command-line terminal window and change directories to the CmdStan home directory.

- Run the makefile target `build` which instantiates the CmdStan utilities
and compiles all necessary C++ libraries.

```
> cd <cmdstan-home>
> make build
```

If your computer has multiple cores and sufficient ram, the build process
can be parallelized by providing the `-j` option. For example, to build on 4 cores, type:
```
> make -j4 build
```

When `make build` is successful, the directory `<cmdstan-home>/bin/`
will contain the executables `stanc`, `stansummary`, and `diagnose` (on Windows, corresponding `.exe` files)
and the final lines of console output will show the version of CmdStan
that has just been built, e.g.:
```
--- CmdStan v2.23.0 built ---
```

**Warning:**  _The Make program may take 10+ minutes and consume 2+ GB of memory to build CmdStan._

**Windows only:** CmdStan requires that the Intel TBB library,
which is built by the above command, can be found by the Windows system.
This requires that the directory
`<cmdstan-home>/stan/lib/stan_math/lib/tbb` is part of the
`PATH` environment variable.
To permanently make this setting for the current user, you may execute:
```
> mingw32-make install-tbb
```
After changing the `PATH` environment variable, you must open an new shell
in order to these setting to take effect.
(This is not necessary on Mac and Linux systems because they can use the
absolute path to the Intel TBB library when linking into Stan programs.)


## Trouble-shooting the installation

To check that the CmdStan installation is complete
and in working order, run the following series of commands:

```
# compile the example
> make examples/bernoulli/bernoulli

# fit to provided data (results of 10 trials, 2 out of 10 successes)
> ./examples/bernoulli/bernoulli sample data file=examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.json.data

# default output written to file `output.csv`,
# default num_samples is 1000, output file should have approx 1050 lines
> ls -l output.csv

# run the `bin/stansummary utility to summarize parameter estimates
> bin/stansummary output.csv
```
The sample data in file `bernoulli.json.data` specifies 2 out of 10 successes, therefore
the range `mean(theta)`$\pm$`sd(theta)` should include 0.2.

Updates to CmdStan or changes in compiler options may result in errors
when trying to compile a Stan program.  In some cases, these can be resolved
by removing the existing CmdStan build and recompiling.
The Makefile target `clean-all` should be run before rebuilding CmdStan:
```
> make clean-all
> make build
```
